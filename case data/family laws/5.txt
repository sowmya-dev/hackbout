3. CO Nos. 27/Jd/98 to 33/Jd/1998 are COs by the assessee for the assessment years 1984-85 to 1990-91 which are directed against the common order of Commissioner of Wealth Tax (Appeals), Udaipur, dated 11-2-1994, inasmuch as the learned Commissioner of Wealth Tax (Appeals) disposed of the appeals before her solely on the ground of invalidity of the assessments due to non-existence of HUF, and did not decide some other substantive grounds taken by the assessee before her on merits.

5. We first take up the appeals of the revenue being Wealth Tax Act Nos. 153/Jp/1994 to 159/Jp/1994 in the above seven appeals for the seven assessment years 1984-85 to 1990-91. The revenue has raised the following common ground :

5. We first take up the appeals of the revenue being Wealth Tax Act Nos. 153/Jp/1994 to 159/Jp/1994 in the above seven appeals for the seven assessment years 1984-85 to 1990-91. The revenue has raised the following common ground :

"On the facts and in the circumstances of the case the learned Commissioner of Wealth Tax (Appeals) has erred in holding the assessment made under section 16(3) as void by observing that the HUF consisted of two members and one of the members having died on 9-5-1991. As such the HUF had not existed when the assessment was made, ignoring the fact that for the Wealth Tax proceedings valuation date is relevant and on the relevant valuation date the HUF was very much existing and, therefore, assessment made subsequently was valid one".

The learned Departmental Representative of revenue has contended that the death of one member of the family out of two members took place on 5-9-1991, whereas the valuation date for the last assessment year (assessment year 1990-91) involved in these appeals being 31-3-1990, none of these assessment years, gets affected by the said event of death on 5-9-1991. He has contended that the assessee-HUF has voluntarily filed Wealth Tax Return for all these years and this is mentioned in the assessment order also. He has contended that the learned Commissioner (Appeals)s basis for holding the reassessments for these assessment years to be invalid has been the death of one out of two remaining coparceners having already taken place by the time of making Wealth Tax Reassessments as the said reassessments for assessment years upto 1989-90 were made on 26-3-1992, and the reassessment for assessment year 1990-91 was made on 12-3-1993. He has contended that the learned Commissioner (Appeals) conclusion is not right inasmuch as it is only the valuation date of the respective assessment years which is relevant and not the date of assessment/reassessment. He has contended that on the respective valuation dates of the assessment years involved in these appeals, the HUF was very much existing. He has, in this regard, also drawn our attention to the provisions of section 3 of the Wealth Tax Act. He has contended that the HUF having once been in existence will come to an end only when complete partition of HUF is there. Citing N.V. Narendranath v. CWT (1969) 74 ITR 190 (SC) the learned Departmental Representative has contended that once property getting character of HUF the said character will not change till partition,. and that even on respective valuation dates in these cases there was no partition. He has contended that in the case of an HUF, property devolves by survivorship and not by inheritance to LRs. He has contended that the assessee voluntarily filed returns as HUF and so there is an admission on the part of the assessee regarding the existence of HUF. He also contended that in case the revenues plea is accepted then the matter should go back to the Commissioner (Appeals) for valuation to the properties as the valuation point has not been decided by the learned Commissioner (Appeals), but it was in issue before him. He has also contended that the Commissioner (Appeals) has relied on the Honble Karnataka High Court in CWT v. G.E. Narayana (1992) 60 Taxman 521 (Karn), but the same is distinguishable on facts.

6. As against this, the learned authorised representative of assessee has contended that the factual details are all available on record. He has contended that as regards the merits of the case, he relies on the orders of the learned Commissioner (Appeals) wherein the learned Commissioner (Appeals) has relied on the judgment of Honble Karnataka High Court (supra), and that the said judgment was followed in income-tax case also. He has referred to the order of Bangalore Tribunal in Asst. CIT v. Nanjappa (HUF) (2000) 74 ITD 407 (Bang-Trib). He has contended that the assessees HUF consisted of two members, that is, Karta Durlabhlal and his wife Shyama Devi. He has contended that they had one daughter who was married as long back as the year 1975. He has contended that for the purpose of making valid assessment/reassessment, the date of assessment/reassessment is material and on that date HUF of assessee was not existing. He has contended that Wealth Tax Act provides machinery for assessing LRS of individuals but not in the case of an HUF. He has also contended that in this case the issue regarding the character of property is not involved.

He has also contended that in this case the issue regarding the character of property is not involved.

7. In the rejoinder, the learned Departmental Representative of revenue has referred to section 19(2) of the Wealth Tax Act and contended that the said provision provides for the assessment of net wealth of a deceased-assessee, being an individual, to be made in the hands of the LRs of the deceased individual assessee. He has contended that so far as HUF and company are concerned, there are no provisions regarding assessments in respect of them in the hands of their LRs, and that it is presumed that an HUF never comes to an end. He has contended that HUF is governed by Hindu Law and a company is governed by Company Law and machinery is provided in those laws. He has contended that according to Hindu Law the assessees HUF was very much existing and the sole surviving member Durlabhlal continues to constitute HUF.

8. We have considered the rival contentions, the relevant material on record as also the cited decisions. In (1969) 74 ITR 190 (SC) (supra), the Honble Supreme Court has referred to their decision in the case of Gowli Buddanna v. CIT (1966) 60 ITR 293 (SC). In that case, one Buddappa, his wife, his two unmarried daughters and his unmarried son, Buddanna were members of an HUF. Buddappa died and after his death the question arose as to whether the income of the properties held by Buddanna as the sole surviving coparcener was assessable as the individual income of Buddanna or as the income of the HUF. It was held by the Honble Supreme Court that since the property which came, into the hands of Buddanna as the sole surviving coparcener was originally joint family property, it did not cease to belong to the joint family and income from it was assessable in the hands of Buddanna as income of the HUF.

9. In the cited facts of the case (1969) 74 ITR 190 (SC) (supra) the property sought to be taxed in the hands of the appellant originally belonged to the HUF consisting of the appellant, his father and his brothers. On partition of the said HUF, the appellant received his share of the properties originally belonging to the said HUF. Relying on the decision of Judicial Committee in Attorney General of Ceylon v. Arunachalam (1958) 34 ITD (ED) 42 (PC) it was held that "it is only by analysing the nature of the rights of the members of the undivided family, both those in being and those yet to be born, that it can be determined whether the family property can properly be described as joint property of the undivided family". The Honble Supreme Court held that when a coparcener having a wife and two minor daughters receives his share of the joint family properties on partition, such property in the hands of the coparcener belongs to the HUF of himself, wife and two minor daughters and cannot be assessed as individual property."

10. For proper appreciation of the issue, it will be desirable to clarify some concepts of Hindu Law being relevant in the matter in hand. Here, we will discuss/elaborate the Hindu Law as per the Mitakshara School being the law prevalent in almost all the parts of India except West Bengal where Dayabhaga School of Hindu Law is followed which is also known as the Bengal School of Law. Under the Mitakshara School of Hindu Law there are two distinct concepts being of (i) "A Joint Hindu family" and (ii) "A Hindu coparcenary". So far as the concept of "Joint Hindu family" or an "HUF" under Hindu Law is concerned, it simply means a Hindu family consisting of all persons lineally descended from a common male ancestor together with their wives and unmarried daughters. Thus, the term "Family" signifies group of people or plurality of members mutually related by blood or by marriage or by adoption. Neither is it necessary that there must be two existing male members to constitute a Hindu joint family nor is it necessary that there must be at least one existing male member in the family to constitute a Hindu joint family. Under this system of Hindu law, even two females may constitute a joint Hindu family, no male member being there notwithstanding. As such, a "Joint Hindu family" or an "HUF under Hindu Law, essentially denotes plurality of members and mutually so related as, mentioned above.
