These apProperty law peals arises out of judgement of the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad dated 31.7.2014, allowing the appeals of the respective Respondent Nos. 1 in the four Civil Appeal Nos. 10683-86 of 2014 before us (hereinafter ‘Respondent Nos. 1’), Signature Not Verified against judgement and order of the Additional District Judge, Digitally signed by GULSHAN KUMAR ARORA Date: 2019.11.25 16:58:44 IST Reason:

Vadodara dated 2.4.2013 and order dated 30.12.2011 of the Additional Senior Civil Judge, Vadodara; and decreeing the suits SCS Nos. 657-660/1988 filed by Respondent Nos. 1 for specific performance against the Appellants herein.

I. Background Facts

2. This case concerns four suits for specific performance filed by the Respondent Nos. 1/Plaintiffs against the Appellants/Defendants Nos. 1-5. One Naranbhai Ramdas Patel (Defendant No. 1, now deceased) was the original owner of property bearing Survey No. 354/1, admeasuring 1 acre and 31 gunthas in Village Manjalpur of Vadodara district (hereinafter ‘suit property’). He, along with Defendants Nos. 2-5 (relatives of Defendant No. 1) executed agreement to sell dated 11.3.1986 (‘1986 agreement’) in respect of the suit property in favour of Respondent Nos. 3-11/Defendants Nos. 6-9 (hereinafter ‘original vendees’), for which the original vendees paid earnest money of Rs. 1,54,251. The suit property was included in Town Planning Scheme No. 19 of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation and possession of the suit property was to be given to the original vendees once the aforesaid Scheme was finalized. A registered sale deed in respect of the suit property was to be executed upon receipt of the remaining consideration from the original vendees, the deadline for which was within three months of finalization of the Town Planning Scheme.

The case of Respondent Nos. 1 is that the original vendees thereafter executed four agreements to sell dated 14.9.1987 (‘1987 agreements’) in respect of four different portions of the suit property, assigning the former’s rights under the 1986 agreement in the latter’s favour, and that earnest money of Rs. 5000/- was paid under each agreement. Notably, the Appellants were not parties to the 1987 agreements.

Under the 1987 agreements, it was purportedly open to Respondent Nos. 1 to make preparations for construction of a housing scheme over the suit property and issue advertisement for the same. Hence they claim that consequently, possession of the suit property was given to them, that a Bhoomi Pujan was conducted for laying foundation stone on the land and the members of the housing scheme were also registered. Further, that they also obtained the layout plan and construction permission for the housing scheme from Vadodara Municipal Corporation at their own cost, and the deceased original owner Mr. Naranbhai Patel had put his signature on the layout plan.

Subsequently, dispute arose between the parties, and the original vendees filed suit SCS No. 194/1988 on 4.4.1988 before the Learned Civil Judge (Senior Division) at Vadodara (hereinafter ‘trial court’), seeking specific performance of the 1986 agreement against the Appellants. They claimed that they had served notice to the Appellants on 11.3.1988 seeking execution of sale deed in their favour, but the latter had given evasive reply to the same; that they were deliberately avoiding execution of sale deed so as to take advantage of increase in real estate prices. Per contra, the Appellants claimed that they had on 25.3.1988, by way of reply to the original vendees’ legal notice, cancelled the 1986 agreement as the original vendees had not paid the remaining consideration as required.

Respondent Nos. 1 were not party to SCS No. 194/1988; and no averment was made in the said suit regarding the 1987 agreements. Instead, on 21.11.88, Respondent Nos. 1 filed four separate suits SCS Nos. 657-660/1988 against the Appellants and the original vendees seeking specific performance of the 1987 agreements. Respondent Nos. 1 alleged that the Appellants and the original vendees were conniving with each other to deny their rights under the 1987 agreements, so as to sell the land to a third party in view of the increasing price of real estate in Vadodara.

The Appellants in their written statements to SCS Nos. 657- 660/1988 denied having any dealings with Respondent Nos. 1 and also stated that the original vendees had never informed them about the 1987 agreements. They averred that since the original vendees had never become the legal owners of the suit property, they did not have any right or authority to enter into any kind of transaction qua the land with Respondent Nos. 1; and that the plaints were concocted to usurp the land.

Both sets of suits, SCS No. 194/1988 and SCS Nos. 657- 660/1988, remained pending for a number of years. During that period, notably, the Appellants and the original vendees acting together executed a Power-of-Attorney dated 11.11.2001 in favour of one Dhananjay Vallabhbhai Patel. It was stated in the Power-of-Attorney that the Appellants and the original vendees are relinquishing their rights in the suit property to Mr. Dhananjay Patel for the purpose of executing sale deed in favour of one Kantilal Ambalal Patel, who is the uncle of the said Dhananjay Patel.

A. Proceedings in SCS No. 194/1988 (Original vendees’ suit)

3. The original vendees filed withdrawal pursis on 26.7.2002 seeking to unconditionally withdraw SCS No. 194/1988 on the ground that the 1986 agreement was fraudulently registered; that they were not aware of the identity of the true owners of the suit property at the time of the 1986 agreement as it was executed through a broker, that the original owners of the suit property had not signed the agreement, nor had they received any consideration; and the 1986 agreement was fraudulently registered, hence no dispute could be raised regarding the suit property. On the same day, Respondent Nos. 1 sought impleadment as co-plaintiffs in SCS No. 194/1988.  The trial court by way of common order dated 22.9.2002 rejected the original vendees’ withdrawal application and allowed the impleadment applications of Respondent Nos. 1. The High Court in revision reversed the trial court’s order, though without going into the merits of the claim made by Respondent Nos. 1. The Court held that the original vendees had an absolute right to withdraw their suit unconditionally irrespective of their motivations for the same. Further, that it was open to Respondent Nos. 1 to raise all available contentions in their separate suits, including admissions, if any, made by the original vendees in their suit SCS No. 194/1988. It was noted that Respondent Nos. 1 cannot be permitted to substitute the original vendees as plaintiffs, as otherwise substantial amendment would be required to the original vendees’ plaint. The special leave petitions filed by Respondent Nos. 1 against the High Court judgement were dismissed by this Court by order dated 16.11.2004 in SLP (Civil) Nos. 22664-65/2004.

Respondent Nos. 1 subsequently made application in SCS No. 658 of 2008, for revival of SCS No. 194/1988, contending that the original vendees had been misled into withdrawing the latter suit; however the application was dismissed by the trial court and the High Court by orders dated 24.1.2008 and 25.3.2008 respectively. Hence the withdrawal of the original vendees’ suit has attained finality.

B. Proceedings in SCS Nos. 657-660/1988 (Present suit)

4. It is relevant to note that though the original plaints in SCS Nos. 657-660/1988 were seeking specific performance only of the 1987 agreements, Respondent Nos. 1 amended their plaints in 2005 to seek a declaration that the 1986 agreement is still in force and that the Appellants were bound to execute the 1986 agreement on the basis of the assignment made in their favour.

The trial court by common order dated 30.12.2011 dismissed all four suits. It rejected Respondent Nos.1/Plaintiffs’ contention that the original vendees had withdrawn their suit SCS No. 194/1988 in collusion with the Appellants herein. This was based on the reasoning that the High Court and this Court had, in the earlier proceedings, sanctioned the unconditional withdrawal of SCS No. 194/1988 and not made any finding of judicial impropriety or fraud.

The trial court further found that in light of revocation of the 1986 agreement by the Appellants and withdrawal of SCS No. 194/1988 by the original vendees, it was not open to the Plaintiffs to re-agitate for specific performance of the said agreement. That in any case, even if the 1986 agreement was assumed to be in force, the original vendees could not have assigned their outstanding obligation to pay the remaining consideration without the written consent of the original owner i.e., Defendant No. 1 Naranbhai. Since the 1987 agreements and the 1986 agreement were not ad idem, and new conditions were laid down in the 1987 agreements, such consent was indispensable.

That neither of the Appellants had given any such consent, either verbally or by conduct; nor was there any evidence that the original vendees had paid the remaining consideration to the Appellants, such that the former’s rights under the 1986 agreement had fortified and consequently passed on to the Plaintiffs under the 1987 agreements. Therefore the 1987 agreements were void, illegal and unenforceable. Further, that the 1987 agreements were also vague and unenforceable inasmuch as the suit property was not specifically defined therein.

The trial court additionally held that the Plaintiffs had not taken any steps, such as depositing the remaining consideration owed by the original vendees, or paying betterment tax as per the terms of the 1987 agreements, to show that they themselves were ready and willing to perform the contracts. Hence this was not a fit case to grant either specific performance or damages, though Respondent Nos. 1 were held enProperty Law titled to return of the earnest money paid by them with interest.

The Learned Additional District Judge, Vadodara by judgement dated 2.04.2013 affirmed the trial court’s findings. It was re-emphasized that a party to a contract cannot assign their obligations thereunder without the other party’s consent. There was nothing on record to show that the Appellants had given such consent. In any case, since the original vendees had never shown their readiness and willingness to pay the balance consideration due by them, no right of specific performance had accrued in their favour. Further, that the original vendees had anyway waived their rights by withdrawing their suit in SCS No. 194/1988. Hence the question of assignment of such a right to Respondent Nos. 1, such that they could claim specific performance of the 1986 agreement as representatives-in-interest of the original vendees under Section 15(b) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 (‘Specific Relief Act’) did not arise.

However, the High Court in the impugned judgement found that there was a definite linkage between the 1986 agreement and the 1987 agreements such that there was a valid assignment of rights in favour of Respondent Nos.1, which made them ‘representatives-in-interest’ of the original vendees for the purpose of Section 15(b) of the Specific Relief Act. The High Court reasoned that since all the material rights under the 1986 agreement were assigned under the 1987 agreements, supplementary conditions specified in the latter did not change the nature of the basic contract.

 Further, that reading Sections 40 and 54 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (‘Transfer of Property Act’) and Section 15(b) of the Specific Relief Act together, the ‘interest’ assignable under Section 15(b) need not be an interest in the property or a charge created in the property. A contractual interest in the form of an obligation annexed to ownership of the property may also be assignable. It was discernible from the facts and evidence on record that the Appellants had given implied consent for such assignment. Mr. Naranbhai Patel’s signature on planning permissions and his presence at the Bhoomi Pujan ceremony were taken as proof that the original owners had consented to the involvement of Respondent Nos. 1 in developing a housing scheme on the suit property. Therefore, it was found that the 1986 agreement remained alive, and the rights derived therefrom in favour of the original vendees were validly assigned under the 1987 agreements.

Additionally, since the High Court and this Court had clarified while sanctioning withdrawal of SCS No. 194/1988 that such withdrawal would not preclude Respondent Nos. 1 from pursuing their independent remedies, the withdrawal of the original vendees’ suit could not prejudice the rights of Respondent Nos. 1 to specific performance. That actual tendering of money was not necessary to evince readiness and willingness to perform the contract as required under Section 16(c) of the Specific Relief Act, and the specific averments made in the pleadings by Respondent Nos. 1 would suffice.

It may be relevant to note at this juncture that the High Court by interim order dated 27.6.2013 had directed Respondent Nos. 1 to deposit an amount equal to five times the amount of original consideration under the 1987 agreements, and Respondent Nos. 1 have submitted that they are ready and willing to forfeit the entire amount deposited in respect of the relief of specific performance, so as to balance equities between the parties.

We further note from the order sheets maintained by this Court that the parties have been directed to maintain status quo during the pendency of the appeal and no steps have been taken for the execution of the impugned judgement.

II. Issues and Submissions made by the Parties

5. Therefore, upon a perusal of the entire record, the following issues arise for our consideration:

Firstly, whether there was a valid assignment of rights by the original vendees in favour of Respondent Nos. 1 under the 1987 agreements?

Secondly, whether the right of Respondent Nos. 1 to seek specific performance survives subsequent to the cancellation of the 1986 agreement by the Appellants and withdrawal of suit in SCS No. 194/1988 by the original vendees?

Thirdly, whether relief may be granted to Respondent Nos. 1, and if so, of what nature?

6. Learned senior counsel for the Appellants, Mr. Ranjit Kumar argued that there was no privity of contract between the Appellants and Respondents Nos. 1 in the respective appeals. That the 1987 agreements were contingent contracts under Section 31 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (‘Contract Act’), as the rights therein could only be enforced upon the completion of the 1986 agreement, and the interest created under the 1987 agreements was also a ‘contingent interest’ under Section 21 of the Transfer of Property Act. Since the 1986 agreement was cancelled, Respondent Nos. 1 could not seek specific performance of the 1987 agreements.

Further, that the purported ‘assignment’ under the 1987 agreements practically amounted to a novation of the 1986 agreement, and the Appellants had not accorded any consent for such an assignment. Even if such an assignment had taken place, there was no evidence to show that Respondent Nos. 1 were ready and willing to perform their contractual obligations. Respondent Nos. 1 had never communicated their willingness to complete their contractual obligations under the 1986 agreement to the Appellants.

Per contra, learned senior counsel for Respondent No. 1, Mr. C.U. Singh argued that the Appellants i.e. the landowners were colluding with the original vendees to avoid sale of the suit property, as evidenced by the fact that the original vendees had not contested the suit at any point of time. He brought to this Court’s notice that there could not have been a termination of the 1986 agreement in 1988 given that in the Power-of-Attorney dated 11.11.2001 (supra) executed by Defendant Nos. 1-9 (the Appellants and the original vendees) in favour of Mr. Dhananjay Patel, it is stated that the original vendees have acquired rights in the suit property under the 1986 agreement. It is not open to the Appellants to accept the existence of the 1986 agreement in the Power-of-Attorney and reject it for the purpose of these suits.

He further relied upon this Court’s decisions in Shyam Singh v. Daryao Singh (Dead) By LRs. and Others , (2003) 12 SCC 160, Ram Baran Prasad v. Ram Mohit Hazra and Others, AIR 1967 SC 744 and Habiba Khatoon v. Ubaidul Huq and others, (1997) 7 SCC 452 to argue that no implied prohibition can be read into the 1986 agreement against assignability of the interest therein. The requirement of consent of the other party for assignment under Section 15(b) of the Specific Relief Act is only applicable in cases where the obligation is of a personal nature or where there is an express bar in the contract prohibiting such assignment of interest. Further, that in any case, the original owner Naranbhai Patel’s conduct in arranging for development permissions and consenting to publication of advertisement regarding development of housing scheme in the suit property shows that there was implied consent for assignment of rights under the 1986 agreement in favour of Respondent Nos. 1.

III. Validity of Assignment of Rights under 1987 Agreements.

A. General principles governing assignability of contracts

7. Upon considering the facts and circumstances of the present case, it is evident that there is no privity of contract between the Appellants and Respondent Nos. 1. Respondent Nos. 1 were not party to the 1986 agreement. Vice versa, the Appellants were not party to the 1987 agreements, though whether or not they had knowledge of the same is disputed. Hence Respondent Nos. 1 cannot seek specific performance of the 1986 agreement, or for that matter, the 1987 agreements, against the Appellants, except by suing as ‘representatives-in-interest’ of the original vendees under Section 15(b) of the Specific Relief Act. Section 15(b) provides that:

 “15. Who may obtain specific performance.— Except as otherwise provided by this Chapter, the specific performance of a contract may be obtained by — …(b) the representative in interest or the principal, of any party thereto: Provided that where the learning, skill, solvency or any personal quality of such party is a material ingredient in the contract, or where the contract provides that his interest shall not be assigned, his representative in interest or his principal shall not be entitled to specific performance of the contract, unless such party has already performed his part of the contract, or the performance thereof by his representative in interest, or his principal, has been accepted by the other party…” It is well-settled that the term ‘representative-in-interest’ includes the assignee of a contractual interest. Though the provisions of the Contract Act do not particularly deal with the assignability of contracts, this Court has opined time and again that a party to a contract cannot assign their obligations/liabilities without the consent of the other party. A Constitution Bench of this Court in Khardah Company Ltd v. Raymon & Co (India) Private Ltd., AIR 1962 SC 1810 has laid out this principle as follows:

“…An assignment of a contract might result by transfer either of the rights or of the obligations thereunder. But  there is a well-recognised distinction between these two classes of assignments. As a rule obligations under a contract cannot be assigned except with the consent of the promisee, and when such consent is given, it is really a novation resulting in substitution of liabilities. On the other hand, rights under a contract are assignable unless the contract is personal in its nature or the rights are incapable of assignment either under the law or under an agreement between the parties.” (emphasis supplied) In Khardah Company, the Appellant jute manufacturers were entitled to receive price for the jute from the buyer/dealer of jute only upon delivery of certain shipping documents. Question arose as to whether such an obligation coupled with a benefit was assignable. This Court held, based on the above-mentioned principle, that the terms of the contract strongly implied that the rights thereunder are non-transferable.
