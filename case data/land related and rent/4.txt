. This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and order dated 31.08.2012 passed by the High Court in Second Appeal No. 5 of 1995. By the impugned judgment, the High Court has set aside the concurrent findings of the Courts below resulting in dismissal of the suit filed by the respondents (plaintiffs) on the ground that the suit was barred by Order II Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to ‘the CPC’) as also constructive res Signature Not Verified Digitally signed by judicata. The High Court has remanded the matter ARJUN BISHT Date: 2019.05.10 18:06:36 IST to the First Appellate Court to decide on merits. Reason:

2. One Tikaram was the husband of respondent No.4 and the father of respondent Nos. 1 to 3. He was holding 8.22 acres of land in Khasra No.189 at Village Gondia in his name. On 21.01.1959, he sold the land to the extent of 3.20 acres out of the total 8.22 acres to the appellants and thereafter, on 11.02.1959, he sold the remaining portion of 4.82 acres of land, which was the balance out of 8.22 acres, also to the appellants. Tikaram passed away on 15.07.1959.

2. The respondents filed a suit (bearing Civil Suit No. 131 of 1963) for setting aside the Sale Deed dated 21.01.1959 and for other reliefs. The allegation made by the respondents in the suit was that the land was a joint family ancestral property and he had sold it for immoral purposes and in a manner prejudicial to the interest of joint family. He was addicted to drink and there was no necessity to sell the property.

3. On 31.01.1969, the Trial Court dismissed the said suit holding that Tikaram was the owner of the property due to the partition effected in the year 1957. Hence, he had the right to sell the suit land. The appellants were bona fide purchasers.

4. Aggrieved by the decree of the Trial Court, the respondents filed an appeal (bearing Civil Appeal NO. 22 of 1969) on 10.02.1971.

5. The respondents again filed the present suit (bearing Civil Suit No. 34 of 1971) challenging the Sale Deed dated 11.02.1959 and seeking other reliefs. It is the said suit which came to be dismissed both by the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court. The Trial Court answered the issues including whether the Suit is barred under Order II Rule 2 and also affected by constructive res judicata. It found that the suit is liable to be dismissed on the ground of Order II Rule 2 and constructive res judicata. The dismissal by the Appellate Court was essentially on the basis of the provisions of Order II Rule 2 of the CPC as also constructive res judicata on the score that the second alienation dated 21.02.1959 ought to have been the subject matter of the earlier suit. The Appellate Court, in fact, found that the Trial Court was right in answering the other points. It is to be noted that the judgment of the Trial Court in the first suit came to be reversed in the civil appeal and the same has become final.

6. The High Court, however, reversing the orders of both the courts found that Order II Rule 2 will not be a bar. For Order II Rule 2, the cause of action in the first suit and the cause of action in the second suit must be identical. In this case, there were two alienations by the Tikaram giving rise to two cause of actions. It is also found that constructive res judicata will not apply.

7. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.

8. Learned counsel for the appellants contended that the High Court has clearly erred in coming to the conclusion that Order II Rule 2 was not a bar. Order II Rule 2 is indeed attracted. He took us through the pleadings in the two suits and contended that the cause of action in the second suit is identical with the cause of action in the first suit. As on the date of the institution of the first suit, the second alienation was very  much available to be impugned and it is not open to the respondents to split the cause of action in separate suits and seek relief which is precisely what has been done by the respondents in this case. He relied upon the judgment of this Court in Coffee Board v. Ramesh Exports Private Limited1 and A.B.C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. v. A.P. Agencies, Salem2.

9. Learned counsel for the respondents drew our attention to Order VII Rule 1. He points out that the cause of action in both the suits are different. He also drew our attention to Article 109 of the Limitation Act, 1963, which reads as follows:

109.

      10.     He     would    contend           that     the       period     of

      limitation       as    far    as    the     second      sale   deed    is

2   (1989) 2 SCC 163


 different from the period of limitation as far as the first sale deed is concerned. The period of limitation as far as the second alienation is concerned will expire only on the expiry of 12 years from the date of taking of possession by the alienee. He further relied on the judgment of this Court in Alka Gupta v. Narender Gupta3.

11. The first question, which we are called upon to decide, is whether the High Court was right in holding that the bar, under Order II Rule 2, will not apply in the facts of this case.

12. Before, we advert to the decisions on the point it would be profitable to refer to the pleadings in two suits.

13. In Civil Suit No. 131 of 1963, we notice the following pleadings. The respondents (plaintiffs) are Hindus governed by Mitakshara School of Law as administered by Benaras School. Tikaram’s father died when Tikaram was a minor. During the minority of Tikaram, the property was managed by his mother. On becoming major, Tikaram fell into bad and immoral habits and grew into a drunkard. 3 (2010) 10 SCC 141 He was also addicted to other vices. He indulged in wasteful habits and therefore sold his joint family ancestral property for immoral purposes and in a manner prejudicial to the interest of the joint family. On the intervention of relations, a partition was entered into on 11.01.1957, which was duly registered.

14. At the time of partition, plaintiff No.2 though begotten was born afterwards on 02.06.1957 and as such he could not and was not made a party to the above partition. Plaintiff No. 3 was born on 26.08.1959 and therefore he had interest in the suit property. At the time of partition, in Khasra No. 189 an area of 8.22 acres was not included in the share of either deceased Tikaram or plaintiff No.1 but was kept joint thereafter. We may notice the following:

“(g) That in or about the month of September, 1958, plaintiffs knew that Tikaram wanted to sale their lands and hence they published a general prohibitory notice in the issue dated 14th September, 1958 of the Hindu Daily “NAVBHARAT” which has wide circulation at Gondia and the surrounding area warning public in general not to accept any transfer of land from deceased Tikaram. That subsequently the  plaintiffs learnt that the defendants intended to enter into a contract of sale with deceased Tikaram in respect of the suit land and hence they served the defendants with a written notice dated 4.1.1959 asking them to desist from purchasing land mentioned in para 1(e) above.
3.That, however, despite warning and notices the defendants purchased a portion of Kh.No. 189 admeasuring 3.20 acres, as particularly described in the plaintiff map by letters Pa, Pha, Ba, Bha, Ma and in red colour, for the alleged consideration of Rs.8,000/- vide registered sale deed dated 21.1.1959.”
15. It is the further case that the property was the ancestral joint family property and the alienation was not one for necessity or for conferring benefits upon the estate or for payment of antecedent debt. It is liable to be set aside. Plaintiff Nos. 1 to 3 have interest in the land by birth and plaintiff No. 4 (the widow of Tikaram) had a share with them. The payment of consideration is fictitious and it never passed. Being without consideration, the alienations were not valid and not binding on the plaintiffs and thus liable to be set aside for this reason. Thereafter, there were certain further allegations with which we are not concerned.

16. The reliefs sought by the plaintiffs in the plaint were to declare the sale deed as not binding on the interest of plaintiff No. 4 and for delivery of possession to her or in the alternative a decree for setting aside the sale deed dated 21.01.1957 and for delivery of possession to the plaintiff, enquiry as to mesne profits and for mandatory injunction to demolish certain constructions.

17. Let us now look at the pleadings in the second suit viz. Civil Suit No. 34 of 1971.

18. Herein also, the plaintiffs and the defendants are the same. It is stated inter alia as follows:

The Bhumidhari land Kh. No. 189 area 8.22 acres situated in village Gondia is the ancestral property of plaintiff Nos. 1, 2 and 3. Plaintiff No. 4 is the mother of plaintiff Nos. 1 to 3. The plaintiffs are Hindu and are governed by Mitakshara Law as administered by Benaras School. The same allegations were raised about Tikaram having fallen into immoral habits and growing into an incorrigible drunkard and selling joint family ancestral lands for immoral purposes. It also referred to partition dated 11.01.1957. There were also allegations relating to Kh. No. 189 wherein 8.22 acres of land was not included either in the share of deceased Tikaram or plaintiff No.1 but was kept joint. It is relevant to extract para 3 of the second plaint which is to the following effect:-

“That, however, despite warning and notices the defendants purchased a portion of Kh. NO. 189 from the deceased father of the plaintiffs admeasuring 3.20 acres vide sale deed dated 21.01.1959. The plaintiffs have filed C.S. No. 131 of 1963 against the defendants for setting aside the said sale. The suit having been dismissed by the trial court the plaintiffs have filed Civil Appeal No. 22/69 against the said judgment and decree which is now pending in the Court of the Assistant Judge, at Bhandara 4(a).
That Tikaram the deceased father of the plaintiffs again on 11.02.1959 sold an area of 4.82 acres out of suit Kh. No. 189 to the plaintiffs under the same circumstances stated above and as described in the plaintiff map by letters Ka, Kha, Ga, Gha, Cha, Chha, Ja, Ta, Tha, Da, Na and Pa and in red colour, for the alleged consideration of Rs.4000/- vide registered sale deed dated 11.2.1959  and the same is sought to be set aside in this suit.”

19. It is further stated that the land is to be treated as an ancestral joint family property and the alienation being not one for necessity or for conferring benefits upon the estate or for payment of antecedent debt and it is liable to be set aside.

20. Having referred to the pleadings, let us examine what the High Court has held. The High Court holds that all successive claims, arising under the same obligation, shall be deemed to constitute one cause of action. It further finds that the crux of the matter is, there are two alienations of separate areas of the land on different dates, and although they are in favour of the same parties, it would give rise to more than one cause of action. It was further found that by restricting to first suit to the first alienation, it could not be found that plaintiff has split-up the claims or split-up the remedies. The execution of the second sale deed in favour of the same party gives rise to distinctive and  separate cause of action. The High Court further proceeds to refer to the illustrations in Order II Rule 2 CPC, which reads as follows:

“A lets a house to B at a yearly rent of Rs. 1200. The rent for the whole of the years 1905, 1906 and 1907 is due and unpaid. A sues B in 1908 only for the rent due for 1906. A shall not afterwards sue B for the rent due for 1905 or 1907”.
21. Thereafter, the High Court proceeds to take a case where A owns two houses and he let them to B. A suit is filed in respect of arrears of rent in respect of one house, though arrears were there in respect of the other house also. The High Court takes the view that it is the choice of the plaintiff either to unite or not to unite both the causes of action and the second suit would not be barred.

22. In the case of Mohammad Khalil Khan v. Mehbub Ali Mian4, the earlier suit related to the property at Oudh. The parties belonged to the Sunni sect and the properties belonged to one Rani Barkatunnissa who owned properties at Shahjahanpur 4 AIR (36) 1949 Privy Council 78 and Oudh. The first suit did not include the property at Shahjahanpur. The Court proceeded to uphold the views taken by the Courts in India and maintained the finding that second suit, in relation to the property at Shahjahanpur, was barred by virtue of Order II Rule 2. It would be profitable to refer to paragraphs 45 and 46 as they throw light upon what constitutes cause of action:

“45. Shortly stated O.2, R.2, Civil P.C., enacts that if a plaintiff fails to sue for the whole of the claim which he is entitled to make in respect of a cause of action in the first suit, then he is precluded from suing in a second suit in respect of the portion so omitted. As pointed out in Moonshee Buzloor Ruheem v. Shumsunnissa Begum, (1867) 11 M.I.A. 551.
The correct test in all cases of this kind is, whether the claim in the new suit is, in fact, founded on a cause of action distinct from that which was the foundation of the former suit….
The object of the rule is clearly to avoid splitting up of claims and to prevent multiplicity of suits”.
