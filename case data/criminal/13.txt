JUDGMENT
"Good name in man and woman, dear my lord, Is the immediate jewel of their souls:

Who steals my purse, steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;

'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:
But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him And makes me poor indeed."1

7. During the course of inquiry, the plaintiff on 15.02.1985 sent a report as being the DCP, South district, which went against the scheme of things. Thereafter, Mr. Marwah set on a course to destroy the credibility of the plaintiff and started bringing false evidence on record in his inquiry against the plaintiff.

It is also averred by the plaintiff that the defendant No. 3 did not publish his version despite the plaintiff having requested him by letters dated 08.05.2014 and 27.05.2014. It is also averred by the plaintiff that the legal notice dated 15.05.2014 issued by him to the defendant No. 3 was not paid heed by the defendant No. 3.

10. The plaintiff has averred that the impugned news report/article published in the newspaper Times of India, Delhi Edn. has portrayed him as a police officer, who acted in violation of duty casted on him by law and who failed to maintain law and order.

12. The plaintiff has averred in the plaint that similar kind of allegations were made against him by one sub-inspector Ramesh Rana, who was posted under defendant No. 2 at the police station Delhi Cantonment during the 1984 riots. It is averred by the plaintiff that during the course of statutory departmental inquiry held against him in the year 1998, after recording of evidence, the credibility of sub- Inspector Rana was rated as nil and the inquiry report was submitted by the commission of inquiries to the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, which was the cadre controlling authority as the plaintiff was an Indian police officer under their command and control.

13. The plaintiff has averred that shortly after the riots in the month of November 1984, he suspended sub inspector Ramesh Rana and the defendant No. 2 pending departmental inquiry, as there were reports against them for reporting very less number of killings in the police Page No. 6/107 station Delhi Cantonment under their jurisdiction, through wireless message as compared to the actual number of killings after first day of rioting. It is further averred by the plaintiff that the killings on the later days could have been averted by deploying additional resources had defendant No. 2 not resorted to underreporting of killings.

14. The plaintiff on 28.04.2014 got the legal notice issued to defendant No. 2 calling upon him to deny the false allegations made against the plaintiff and also tender an unqualified public apology through media by 12.05.2014. It is further averred by the plaintiff that in case the defendant No. 2 decides to stick to his guns of the false allegations and fails to produce genuine and cogent evidence in support of his allegations, the plaintiff intends to file civil and criminal proceedings of defamation and other related offences in appropriate court of law at the risk of defendant No. 2. It is averred by the plaintiff that a copy of notice dated 28.04.2014 was also issued to defendant No. 1 for necessary action, as per the notice.

15. The plaintiff has averred that he never received any response from defendant Nos. 1 and 2 to his notice dated 28.04.2014 by 12.05.2014. It is also averred by the plaintiff that meanwhile it came to his notice that defendant No. 1 had also published the false and baseless offending material on the website of Cobrapost. The plaintiff has averred that in view of the allegations interspersed with anchor's indecently abusive and unjustifiably defamatory comments, a supplementary legal notice dated 15.05.2014 was issued to defendant Page No. 7/107 No. 1. It is averred by the plaintiff that in his supplementary legal notice he had stated that the so-called "sting" was carried out and published not to serve any public good but to earn fat money by illegitimate means at the opportune time of General Elections 2014.

16. The plaintiff has averred in the plaint that the defendant No. 1 chose defendant No. 2, who had animus and grudge against the plaintiff. It is further averred by the plaintiff that the defendant No. 2 had an old axe to grind with him and was hellbent to lower the estimation of the plaintiff in the eyes of the public at large and damage his credibility and reputation. It is further averred by the plaintiff that the defendant No. 1 manipulated everything to make the story more sensational and saleable.

17. The plaintiff in paragraph No. 13 of the plaint has averred that it was common knowledge that as far as South district was concerned, the highest number of deaths of victim community, as per the Nanavati Commission report were 341 in the area of police station under the jurisdiction of defendant No. 2. The plaintiff has further averred that according to the Nanavati Commission Report, there was not even a single death in various other police stations situated in South district, such as Nizamuddin, Lodhi Colony, Defence Colony, Sarojini Nagar (earlier known as Vinay Nagar). It is averred by the plaintiff that the allegations levelled by defendant No. 2 are false, as the other police stations within the jurisdiction did not permit law and order situation to slip through hands and saved loss of life and property but it was the police station under the jurisdiction of defendant No. 2 where maximum Page No. 8/107 loss of lives and property occurred. The plaintiff has averred that where on one hand nine police stations other than the police station Delhi Cantonment could contain the loss of life and property, the spread of virus and the blame cannot be casted upon the DCP. It is averred by the plaintiff that the source of mischief, negligence would be the local station house officer of that particular police station i.e. SHO, P.S. Delhi Cantonment, Rohtas Singh. The plaintiff has further averred that it is a mystery that how defendant No. 1 believed the version of defendant No.2 as gospel truth. The plaintiff has averred that if defendant No. 2 had made some incriminating statements against him in unguarded moments during the so-called sting, it could have some significance but it is evident from the statements made by defendant No. 2 that he was simply offering his defence by blaming others.

18. The plaintiff has averred that the sting operation is a collaborative adventure between the defendant No.1 and defendant No. 2 in which both of them stood to gain in their own way, the defendant No.1 by creating a sensational story and defendant No. 2 availing a platform to provide and offer defence.

19. The plaintiff has averred in the plaint that he had been publicly appreciated by the members of the victim community in saving lives, particularly in the area of police station Nizamuddin and the felicitation function held was attended by the plaintiff along with other local police officers after seeking due permission from the departmental authorities. It is also averred by the plaintiff that individual members of the victim Page No. 9/107 community have appreciated his services in saving lives elsewhere in the South district. It is further averred by the plaintiff that the same is a matter of record in the various inquiry reports and in case it becomes necessary, the inquiry report will be proved during the trial of the suit.

20. The plaintiff has averred in the plaint that malice and lack of good faith on the part of defendant No.1 are evident from the fact that during the sting operation, the defendant No.1 took the version of other senior officers but wilfully avoided the plaintiff to take his version of facts, as the same would have demolished the defamatory statements made by his cohort, defendant No. 2. It is averred by the plaintiff that the defendant No. 1 omitted in narration to highlight the statement of the then station house officer of Mehrauli police station, namely, Jaipal Singh, who can be clearly seen and heard stating in the impugned sting video that the plaintiff was deliberately targeted by Mr. Marwah (Marwah Inquiry Committee of November 1984) for extraneous reasons.

21. The plaintiff has averred that the timing of publishing the sting operation in print by the defendant No. 1 as well as electronic media exposes the defendant No. 1 in his purpose and intent which is not to serve any public good but to make maximum money for himself as in the print media i.e. Times of India Article dated 22.04.2014, the statements of SHO level officers are shown recorded in the year 2011 but to lend the sting currency in time, the defendant No. 1 recorded the statements of Gautam Kaul and Subhash Tandon in 2014 at the time of Page No. 10/107 voting for General Elections 2014. It is averred by the plaintiff that the same shows that the defendant No. 1 wanted to bargain form the maximum price with the political parties at the opportune time.

22. The plaintiff has averred in the plaint not only by self-serving, false statements of the defendant No. 2 but also in defendant No. 1's scurrilous anchoring, he falsely projected with malicious intention and not in good faith to make his story sensational that Nanavati Commission had recommended penal action against the plaintiff but the plaintiff escaped action because of the fact of him having retired from the police services. The plaintiff has averred that on study of the Nanavati Commission Report it is disclosed no such recommendation for penal action was made. It is further averred that in fact there was no complaint affidavit against the plaintiff filed before the Nanavati Commission. It is averred by the plaintiff that the Nanavati Commission Report has reiterated the contents of Kusum Lata Mittal Report based on which a departmental inquiry was held against the plaintiff in the year 1988 and after recording of evidence no charge was proved against the plaintiff. The government unjustifiably and in violation of the rules disagreed with the findings of the Inquiry Report of the Commissioner of Inquiries. The plaintiff has averred that he battled against the decision of the government to not accept the departmental inquiry and challenged the same before the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi and an interim order dated 23.09.1998 was passed in favour of the plaintiff.

Page No. 11/107

23. The plaintiff has averred that the matter was sub judice before the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi when he was summoned by the Nanavati Commission. The plaintiff has further averred that for the final decision the matter went up to the Central Administrative Tribunal and it was observed by the Central Administrative Tribunal that the plaintiff has been made a scapegoat and accordingly set aside the adverse order passed by the government with regard to the plaintiff's pension.

24. The plaintiff has averred that all the facts and circumstances averred by him in the plaint revealed the malicious intention, lack of good faith on the part of the defendant Nos. 1 and 2, to scandalise the plaintiff by the so-called sting operation. It is averred by the plaintiff that the defendant No. 1 resorted to such dubious tactics to make his story sensational and more saleable with no concern that it is the plaintiff's reputation which would be a collateral damage. It is averred by the plaintiff that in media one can make a false statement and get away, whereas in judicial proceedings in a court of law making a false statement may land a person in jail. It is further averred by the plaintiff that a notice dated 15.05.2014 was sent by him to the defendant No. 1 to confirm whether any reply to his notice dated 28.04.2014 had been sent by him to the plaintiff. A similar notice was also dispatched to defendant No. 2.

25. With regard to defendant No. 3, the plaintiff has averred that the defendant number three was concerned by publishing the impugned news item, which caused intense damage to the reputation of the Page No. 12/107 plaintiff and even lowered his estimation amongst retired police officers, serving police officers, relatives, friends and known social circles. It is averred by the plaintiff that the defendant No. 3 did not act in good faith and abandoned due care and caution at the peril of plaintiff's reputation. It is further averred by the plaintiff that the defendant No. 3 did not adhere to the professional standards and ethics of journalism, as he did not specify himself about the truth of the statements made against the plaintiff. It is averred by the plaintiff that journalists do not enjoy special privilege in cases of defamation and are at par with ordinary citizens. It is averred by the plaintiff in the plaint that ostensible show off in the news item cannot vouch for the interviews and the same is a subterfuge to collude with the mala fide, evil designs of defendant Nos. 1 and 2.

26. The plaintiff has averred in the plaint that the defendants acted wrongfully, maliciously and dishonestly with reckless disregard for truth and resultant of which the defendants are joint tortfeasors and are jointly and severally liable for damages be it general, special, exemplary and punitive for causing pecuniary and nonpecuniary losses to the plaintiff. It is averred by the plaintiff that he has suffered huge and substantial damage, as he is widely known in the areas of his postings among the retired and serving officers and as a minimalistic estimate, the plaintiff claims â‚¹15,00,000/- (Rupees Fifteen lakhs only) as damages from the defendants.

27. The plaintiff has averred that the cause of action arose to prefer and maintain the present suit against the defendants arose on 22.04.2014, Page No. 13/107 when the impugned news article/report was published in the newspaper and thereafter subsequent cause of action arose on the dates when the plaintiff issued notice to the defendants. It is averred by the plaintiff that the cause of action arose in Dwarka, New Delhi where the newspaper in question is widely circulated and read. It is also averred by the plaintiff that the cause of action arose in New Delhi as serious injury and damage has been caused to his reputation. Hence, the suit for damages to the tune of â‚¹15,00,000/- (Rupees Fifteen lakhs only) on account of the plaintiff being defamed by the defendants.

28. The written statement preferred by Aniruddha Bahal (defendant No. 1) has taken the preliminary objection of the suit being barred for misjoinder of parties. The defendant No. 1 has also taken a preliminary objection of no cause of action having arisen in favour of the plaintiff to prefer a suit for damages against the defendant No. 1. The defendant No. 1 has also taken a preliminary objection that the plaint is bereft of any single averment with regard to in whose eyes and for whom the plaintiff has been defamed. The defendant No. 1 has taken a preliminary objection that the plaint preferred by the plaintiff is nothing but false and concocted facts to mislead the Court and to harass the defendant No. 1. The defendant No. 1 has also taken a preliminary objection on the maintainability of the suit for want of jurisdiction.

29. From the perusal of the reply on merits in the written statement, the defence urged by the defendant No. 1 is that of a shield of the justification of truth.

It is also averred by defendant No. 1 in his defence that he absolutely has no commercial interest. In short, the defendant No. 1, has urged in his defence that he never sullied the reputation of the plaintiff and with the plaintiff not being defamed, no case for awarding damages is made out.

31. The written statement preferred by the defendant No. 2 is also on the similar lines of the defendant No. 1 that no disrepute has been caused to the plaintiff. It is urged by the defendant No. 2 that the plaintiff had unfairly and in a biased manner impleaded him on false grounds in an arbitrary and illegal manner in the year 1984. It is averred by the defendant No. 2 in his statement that the plaintiff is nursing an Page No. 15/107 old grudge against the defendant No. 2, which is apparent nay evident from the plaint.

32. The defendant No. 2 has also urged that the suit is not maintainable against him for want of cause of action.

It is averred by the defendant No. 2 that the plaintiff was biased towards him on account of the defendant No. 2 being an upright officer for which the plaintiff suspended him temporarily. It is averred by the defendant No. 2 that the plaintiff did not disclose in his plaint that the defendant No. 2 was reinstated with all the benefits and even promoted to the rank of Asstt. Commissioner of Police. The defendant No. 2 has averred in the written statement that the plaintiff has concealed the fact from this Court that the defendant No. 2 was given a clean chit by the Ranganath Misra Commissioner. It is further averred by the defendant Page No. 16/107 No. 2 that the plaintiff had been hellbent to ruin his reputation. In short, the defendant No. 2 has denied having defamed the plaintiff in any manner. The defendant No. 2 has urged that the suit preferred by the plaintiff against him be dismissed as no case of defamation is made out.

35. The written statement preferred on behalf of the defendant No. 3 assails the maintainability of the suit for being a total abuse of process of law.

36. The defendant No. 3 has stated in his defence that the news article published relied upon a sting and the defendant repeatedly emphasised the fact that the sting revealed are only allegations and defendant did not in any way endorse them. It is urged by the defendant No. 3 that he was careful in ensuring that nowhere did it appear that it was either vouching for the authenticity of the sting and the allegations made by those stung, even if the tapes were authentic. The defendant No. 3 has averred in his written statement that he was careful to an extent that he even made it clear in the article that Rohtas Singh (defendant No. 2 herein), the man making the allegations against the plaintiff was himself indicted by an inquiry commission.

37. The defendant No. 3 has urged in his defence that the news article/report was published based on the premise, for the information of his readers in public interest without any illegal or malice against the plaintiff. It is averred by the defendant No. 3 that it is within common knowledge that innocent people of particular community lost their lives and with passage of time there are people, who are still fighting in Page No. 17/107 Courts to get justice. It is urged by the defendant No. 3 that the sting was on matter of public interest and the same was published for the information of the readers as the readers have a right to know, which is a part of freedom of speech of expression indeed a valuable right granted by the Constitution of the country. The defendant No. 3 has averred that the article was published only with the intention to inform its readers about the sting and what has come out in the sting without giving his views or vouching for the authenticity of the sting of statements of the stung.

38. The defendant No. 3 has denied all the allegations made by the plaintiff and taken a stance that no case for defamation is made out in favour of the plaintiff and the question of awarding damages to the tune of â‚¹15,00,000/- (Rupees Fifteen lakhs only) does not arise.
