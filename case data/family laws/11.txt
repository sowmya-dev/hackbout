16. During the pendency of the present legal proceedings, one of the subject wards, namely, Bharat Kumar attained majority. It is ob- served that Bharat Kumar appeared before the Court on 22.02.2020 and recorded his statement that he has no objection if the petition is al- lowed in favour of the petitioners qua his sister, namely, Yashika.

17. This Court further observed that pursuant to the notice issued to the concerned SDM, Dwarka (South West), a report was filed ascer- taining the status of the petitioners. As per the SDM report, the peti- tioners along with their children and the subject wards have been re- siding at House No. 245, 4-E, Pipal Wali Gully, Raj Nagar Part - II, Palam Colony, New Delhi - 110045.

18. Mr. Nikhil Gautam, learned counsel for the petitioners submit- ted that the petitioners have sought a dual relief from this Court, firstly, appointment of the petitioners as lawful guardians of the sub- ject wards and secondly, appointment as guardians in person and of the properties of the subject wards.

GP No. 14/2018 Page No. 8/14

19. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the peti- tioners are entitled persons to apply for orders as guardians of the sub- ject wards, as per Section 8 of the Wards Act and the petitioners have adduced evidence in support of the petition, as per the mandate of the Section 13 of the Wards Act.

20. Mr. N. Gautam, learned counsel for the petitioners further sub- mitted that Section 7 of the Wards Act empowers the district Court to appoint a guardian in respect of the person or property or both of a ward to the satisfaction of the Court, if the same is for the welfare of the ward. The learned counsel further laid emphasis that the petitioner No. 1 is the full blood brother of the father of the subject wards and on account of the subject wards being orphaned, the petitioners as a hus- band and wife have taken a moral, social and conscious decision to not only fend and provide for them but also apply for their lawful guardianship in person and property.

21. The learned counsel for the petitioners further submitted that the appointment of the petitioners as the guardian of person and property of the subject wards would be in their best interest, as the subject wards are orphans and the petitioners have raised them as their own children.

22. Section 7 of the Wards Act, empowers the district Court to ap- point a guardian in respect of the person or property of a minor if the same is required for the welfare of the minor. Section 29 of the Wards Act places certain restrictions on the guardian so appointed to deal with the property of the minor, except with the permission of the GP No. 14/2018 Page No. 9/14 Court. Specifically, clause (a) of Section 29 requires a guardian ap- pointed by the court to seek previous permission of the court for sale of any part of the immovable property of the ward. Section 31 of the Wards Act, empowers the court to grant the permission under Section 29 and lays down the procedure which may be followed inter alia sub section 3 (b) for sale of the immovable property of the minor. While granting permission sought by the appointed guardian to sell the mi- nor's property, necessity or an evident advantage to the minor, as an essential requirement under sub-section (1) of Section 31 has to be considered.

23. That said, the documents on record including the Aadhaar Cards of the subject wards, namely, Bharat Kumar state his year of birth as 2001 and that of Yashika is 20.01.2009. Bharat Kumar appeared be- fore the Court on 22.02.2020 recorded his statement that he was born on 28.08.2001. Bharat Kumar during the pendency of the present pro- ceedings attained the age of majority and accordingly on 22.02.2020 recorded his no objection statement in favour of the petitioners with regard to their appointment as guardians of his minor sister i.e. subject ward. It is held that the relief sought by the petitioners with regard to them being appointed as guardians of Bharat Kumar has become in- fructuous.

24. This Court observes and finds that there is no legal impediment to not allow the petition moved by the petitioners seeking their ap- pointment as lawful guardians of Yashika and her property, which has devolved upon her on account of the demise of her parents, particu- GP No. 14/2018 Page No. 10/14 larly, mother on 15.05.2018. It is also observed that no evidence has come on record and/or any objection from any quarter against the peti- tioners' appointment as guardians in person and property of subject ward. As a matter of fact, the close relatives from the paternal side and from the maternal side of the subject wards appeared before Court on 23.10.2018 and recorded their no objection statements in favour of the petitioners.

25. Further, the parents of the subject wards were of Hindu religion. As per Section 15 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, the property of a female Hindu dying intestate shall devolved upon her son and daughters (including the children of any predeceased son or daughter) and the husband. In the case at hand, the husband of Savita prede- ceased her on 12.12.2015 and as per Section 15 read with Section 16 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, the properties of Savita shall de- volve equally upon the subject wards. As it is observed earlier that one of the subject ward, namely, Bharat Kumar has attained majority, the petitioners can only be appointed guardians of subject ward - Yashika.

26. Accordingly, the petitioners are appointed as the guardians of the subject ward, namely, Yashika and also of her properties, particu- larly, bank accounts of Savita maintained with Punjab National Bank, B - 1, Community Centre, Janakpuri, New Delhi with regard to A/c No. 1503000109105139, and Bank of Baroda, Basant Gaon, New Delhi - 110057 A/c No. 2130100006931.

GP No. 14/2018 Page No. 11/14

27. Let a guardianship certificate be issued in favour of the petition- ers as the guardians in person and of the above mentioned bank ac- counts of the subject ward, namely, Yashika.

28. The petitioners are directed to deposit the one half of ₹14,63,689.35/- (Rupees Fourteen lakhs sixty three thousand six hundred eighty nine and thirty five paise) the balance in the account of Savita with Bank of Baroda, Basant Gaon, New Delhi in a fixed deposit receipt (FDR) with the State Bank of India, Sector 10, Dwarka Courts Complex, Delhi within 30 days from today in favour of the subject ward, Yashika. Let the fixed deposit receipt (FDR) remain deposited in the above manner with State Bank of India, Sector 10, Dwarka Courts Complex, Delhi until the subject ward attains the age of majority. The same shall be done under an intimation to this Court and the fixed deposit receipt shall be placed in court within 4(four) weeks from the date of deposit of the fixed deposit.

29. The petitioners are granted liberty to seek withdrawal of one half of the total balance in the account of Savita with Punjab National Bank, B-1, Community Centre, Janak Puri, New Delhi and deposit the same either in the bank account of Yashika, if any. This Court deems it necessary to direct the guardians, viz., petitioners that in case there is no bank account of the subject ward, namely, Yashika, to open a bank account with the nationalized bank closest to their place of residence or at State Bank of India, Dwarka Courts Complex, Sector-10, New Delhi in the name of the subject ward through the guardians for GP No. 14/2018 Page No. 12/14 current expenses of the ward's maintenance and also for investment of surplus money, if any. In order to enable a bank to open an account in the name of the subject ward through the guardians, let an attested copy of the guardianship certificate be supplied to the petitioners for compliance and necessary action.

30. This Court deems appropriate to observe that under no circumstance, this order shall be construed as an expression of opinion on the title of the subject ward over the subject properties.

31. The guardianship certificate shall be issued subject to filing of an indemnity bond in terms of Section 34(a) of the Act read with Rule 5 Part B Chapter 2 Volume II of the Delhi High Court Rules in the sum of one half of ₹14,63,689.35/- (Rupees Fourteen lakhs sixty three thousand six hundred eighty nine and thirty five paise). The bond shall be in Form 'D' annexed to the said Rules.

32. In view of Section 34(b) of the Act, petitioners are further di- rected to deliver to the Court, within 6(six) months from this date, a statement of the immovable property belonging to the ward, if any and also of the money received by them up to the date of delivering the statement. The bond shall, to the extent possible, be in Form 'E' an- nexed to the said Rules. The petitioners are directed to keep the bank passbooks, statements with them and produce them for inspection by the Court atleast once a year. The petitioners are also restricted to not remove the subject ward from the jurisdiction of the Union of India without having sought the leave of the Court in accordance with law.
