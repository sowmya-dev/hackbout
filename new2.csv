"Leave granted.

Appellants calls in question legality of the judgment rendered by a Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court which set aside the judgment of the learned Single Judge and directed that departmental proceedings were not to be continued until conclusion of criminal charge.

Background facts in a nutshell are as under:

Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the 'employer') is a Government of India enterprise.

Officials of the Central Bureau of Investigation (in short the 'CBI') raided the house of the respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 'employee') on 13.3.1998 and found that he was in possession of assets disproportionate to his known sources of income and consequently a case was registered on 5.5.1998. After completion of investigation charge sheet was filed. In the meantime departmental proceedings were initiated against the respondent and charge sheet was issued. The employee filed a writ petition before the Andhra Pradesh High Court taking the stand that departmental proceedings should be stayed till completion of the criminal case. It was specifically stated that once sanction has been granted to launch criminal prosecution nothing further warrants initiation and continuance of departmental proceedings as the issues involved in both the departmental inquiry and the criminal case are identical. The appellants filed counter affidavit stating that raid was conducted in the year 1988 and after completion of investigation, CBI requested the employer-appellant no.1 to sanction prosecution on 21.12.2000 and on 19.6.2001 sanction has been accorded to prosecute the employee for the criminal charges. Though CBI had filed the charge sheet there was no noticeable progress for four years. Employer initiated the disciplinary proceedings on the ground that continuation of the employee in service of the employer-Corporation would not be in the public interest. Learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition holding that there is no legal bar on departmental proceedings and criminal case continuing simultaneously even though they are based on identical or similar set of facts. Reference was made to a decision of this Court in Capt. M. Paul Anthony vs. Bharat Gold Mines Ltd. and Anr. (1999 (3) SCC 679). Matter was carried in appeal by the employee before the Division Bench of the High Court in writ appeal and by the impugned judgment the High Court held that there were 3 charges indicated in the charge sheet. The first related to possession of assets disproportionate to the known sources of income and the other two related to misconduct in (a) not filing correct property returns and/or (b) not filing return at all for some years as required under Rule 13(1)(c) of the Hindustan Petroleum Management Employees Conduct, Discipline and Appeal Rules, 1976 (in short the 'Rules'). The third charge related to failure of the respondent- employee to file property returns for the years 1991-92, 1994-95, 1995- 96, 1996-97 and 1997-98. The High Court stated that though the charges 2 and 3 related to non-disclosure or non-submission of property returns they are relatable to the first charge relating to possession of assets disproportionate to the known sources of income. It would not be safe to permit the appellants to continue the departmental proceedings till completion of criminal case. However, an opportunity was given to take steps for early disposal.

In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellants submitted that charges 2 and 3 as noted above are different from the charge no.1 which related to possession of assets disproportionate to the known sources of income. The Criminal Court will have no occasion to deal with those charges. Further the criminal case is under Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (in short the 'PC Act'). It would not be proper to continue respondent in the employment of the appellants as it would not be in the public interest and in any event the respondent would be able to place facts relevant to all the charges in the departmental proceedings.

Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that respondent-employee would be required to disclose its defence and in any event charge no.1 is not covered by any of the provisions of the Rules and the departmental authorities have no jurisdiction to deal with the matter in any departmental proceedings. Additionally, it is submitted that the trial has commenced and, therefore, the order of the High Court is correct in view of what has been stated in Capt. M. Paul Anthony's case (supra).

It is fairly well-settled position in law that on basic principles proceedings in criminal case and departmental proceedings can go on simultaneously, except in some cases where departmental proceedings and criminal case are based on the same set of facts and the evidence in both the proceedings is common. It is in these cases, the Court has to decide, taking into account special features of the case, whether simultaneous continuance of both would be proper.

The purpose of departmental enquiry and of prosecution is two different and distinct aspects. The criminal prosecution is launched for an offence for violation of a duty the offender owes to the society, or for breach of which law has provided that the offender shall make satisfaction to the public. So crime is an act of commission in violation of law or of omission of public duty. The departmental enquiry is to maintain discipline in the service and efficiency of public service. It would, therefore, be expedient that the disciplinary proceedings are conducted and completed as expeditiously as possible. It is not, therefore, desirable to lay down any guidelines as inflexible rules in which the departmental proceedings may or may not be stayed pending trial in criminal case against the delinquent officer. Each case requires to be considered in the backdrop of its own facts and circumstances. There would be no bar to proceed simultaneously with departmental enquiry and trial of a criminal case unless the charge in the criminal trial is of grave nature involving complicated questions of fact and law. Offence generally implies infringement of public duty, as distinguished from mere private rights punishable under criminal law. When trial for criminal offence is conducted it should be in accordance with proof of the offence as per the evidence defined under the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act 1872 (in short the 'Evidence Act'). Converse is the case of departmental enquiry. The enquiry in a departmental proceedings relates to conduct or breach of duty of the delinquent officer to punish him for his misconduct defined under the relevant statutory rules or law. That the strict standard of proof or applicability of the Evidence Act stands excluded is a settled legal position. Under these circumstances, what is required to be seen is whether the department enquiry would seriously prejudice the delinquent in his defence at the trial in a criminal case. It is always a question of fact to be considered in each case depending on its own facts and circumstances.

A three-judge Bench of this Court in Depot Manager, A.P. State Road Transport Corporation v. Mohd. Yousuf Miya and Ors. (1997 (2) SCC

699) analysed the legal position in great detail on the above lines.

The aforesaid position was also noted in State of Rajasthan v. B.K. Meena (1996 (6) SCC 417).

There can be no straight jacket formula as to in which case the departmental proceedings are to be stayed. There may be cases where the trial of the case gets prolonged by the dilatory method adopted by delinquent official. He cannot be permitted to, on one hand, prolong criminal case and at the same time contend that the departmental proceedings should be stayed on the ground that the criminal case is pending.

In Capt. M. Paul Anthony's case (supra) this Court indicated some of the fact situations which would govern the question whether departmental proceedings should be kept in abeyance during pendency of a criminal case. In paragraph 22 conclusions which are deducible from various decisions were summarised. They are as follows:

(i) Departmental proceedings and proceedings in a criminal case can proceed simultaneously as there is no bar in their being conducted simultaneously, though separately.

(ii) If the departmental proceedings and the criminal case are based on identical and similar set of facts and the charge in the criminal case against the delinquent employee is of a grave nature which involves complicated questions of law and fact, it would be desirable to stay the departmental proceedings till the conclusion of the criminal case.

(iii) Whether the nature of a charge in a criminal case is grave and whether complicated questions of fact and law are involved in that case, will depend upon the nature of offence, the nature of the case launched against the employee on the basis of evidence and material collected against him during investigation or as reflected in the charge-sheet.

(iv) The factors mentioned at (ii) and (iii) above cannot be considered in isolation to stay the departmental proceedings but due regard has to be given to the fact that the departmental proceedings cannot be unduly delayed.

(v) If the criminal case does not proceed or its disposal is being unduly delayed, the departmental proceedings, even if they were stayed on account of the pendency of the criminal case, can be resumed and proceeded with so as to conclude them at an early date, so that if the employee is found not guilty his honour may be vindicated and in case he is found guilty, the administration may get rid of him at the earliest.

It is to be noted that in cases involving Section 13 (1)(e) of the P.C. Act, the onus is on the accused to prove that the assets found were not disproportionate to the known sources of income. The expression 'known sources of income' is related to the sources known to the authorities and not the accused. The Explanation to Section 13(1) of the P.C. Act provides that for the purposes of the Section, ""known sources of income"" means income derived from any lawful source and such receipt has been intimated in accordance with the provisions of any law, rules or orders for the time being applicable to a public servant. How the assets were acquired and from what source of income is within the special knowledge of the accused. Therefore, there is no question of any disclosure of defence in the departmental proceedings. In the criminal case, the accused has to prove the source of acquisition. He has to satisfactorily account for the same. Additionally, issues covered by charges 2 and 3 cannot be the subject matter of adjudication in the criminal case.

That being the position, the High Court was not justified in directing stay of the departmental proceedings pending conclusion of the criminal charge. As noted in Capt. M. Paul Anthony's case (supra) where there is delay in the disposal of a criminal case the departmental proceedings can be proceeded with so that the conclusion can be arrived at an early date. If ultimately the employee is found not guilty his honour may be vindicated and in case he is found guilty the employer may get rid of him at the earliest.

Regarding aspects which are related to the criminal case, we do not express any opinion. The appellants are free to continue departmental proceedings. Since the criminal trial has commenced, it would be in the interest of parties to assist the Court for its expeditious disposal.

The appeal is allowed accordingly with no order as to costs.s",cr
"M. R. Shah, J.

1. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 25.09.2019 passed by the High Court of Uttarakhand at Nainital in Writ Petition (PIL) No. 31 of 2016, the District Bar Association, Dehrarun, through its Secretary, has preferred the present SLP. That by the impugned judgment and order, the High Court in the writ petition (PIL) filed by the private respondent herein has issued the following directions:

Signature Not Verified Digitally signed by ARJUN BISHT âThe District Bar Associations of Dehradun, Haridwar and Date: 2020.02.28 14:58:58 IST Udham Singh Nagar shall, forthwith, withdraw their call for a strike, Reason:

and start attending Courts on all working Saturdays. All the District Bar Associations in the State shall forthwith refrain from abstaining from Courts because of condolence references for family members of Advocates, or for other reasons. In case they do not start attending Courts, as directed hereinabove, the District Judges concerned shall submit their respective reports to the High Court for it to consider whether action should be initiated against the errant Advocates under the Contempt of Courts Act.

The Bar Council of India shall at the earliest, and in any event within three months from today, take action against the recalcitrant Bar Associations pursuant to its show-cause notice dated 12.07.2019, and ensure that these Bar Associations desist from continuing such strikes/boycott of Courts.

The Uttarakhand State Bar Council shall, within a period of four weeks from today, initiate disciplinary action against the office bearers of the aforesaid District Bar Associations for their having given a call for illegal strikes/boycott of Courts on Saturdays in the judgeship of Dehradun, Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar.

The District Judges of these districts shall ensure that Courts function on Saturdays, and sufficient cases are listed and are disposed of by Courts, under their judgeship, on all working Saturdays.

The Commissioner of Police/Senior Superintendent of Police, of the concerned districts, shall, as and when requested by the District Judge or a Judicial Officer, regarding the possibility of Court proceedings being impeded because of strike/boycott of Courts by Advocates, forthwith provide necessary police protection to ensure smooth functioning of Courts, and thereby prevent any impediment to Court proceedings because of strikes/boycott by Bar Associations/Advocates.

The High Court is requested to consider taking appropriate measures to ensure functioning of Courts on Saturdays, that judicial work is not hampered by such illegal strikes/boycott of Courts and wholly unjustified condolence references, and that the Circular issued by it earlier on 12.03.2019 is implemented.â

2. From the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court, it appears that the Advocates in the entire District of Dehradun, in several districts of Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar district in the State of Uttarakhand have been boycotting the Courts on all Saturdays for the past more than 35 years. As the strikes are seriously obstructing the access to justice to the needy litigants, respondent No. 1 was compelled to approach the High Court by way of Writ Petition (PIL). Having noted from the information sent by the High Court to the Law Commission that with respect to the State of Uttarakhand for the years 2012-

2016 showed that in Dehradun district, the Advocates were on strike for 455 days (on an average 91 days per year) and in Haridwar district it is 515 days (about 103 days per year), the High Court was of the opinion that on all such working days on account of strikes and the conduct of the Advocates in boycotting Courts, it has affected the functioning of the Courts and it contributes to the ever-mounting pendency of the cases, and therefore aforesaid directions have been issued by the High Court.

3. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court, the District Bar Association, Dehradun has preferred the present SLP.

4. Shri Mahabir Singh, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner has vehemently submitted that the High Court has not properly appreciated and considered the fact that the right to go on strike/boycott courts is a fundamental right to Freedom of Speech and Expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India.

4.1 It is vehemently submitted by the learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner that the strike is a mode of peaceful representation to express the grievances by the lawyersâ community in absence of no other forum is available.

4.2 It is further submitted by the learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner that the High Court ought to have held that the protection conferred by Section 48 of the Advocates Act is for any act done in good faith and therefore the directions issued by the High Court to take action against the Advocates on strike would be contrary to the protection conferred by Section 48 of the Advocates Act.

5. The learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner has stated at the Bar that, as such, the Bar Association has already withdrawn the strike and/or boycotting Courts on all Saturdays, his statement is taken on record.

6. Having heard the learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner and considering the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court, more particularly, the directions issued by the High Court, which are reproduced hereinabove, we are of the firm opinion that the High Court is absolutely justified in issuing such directions. As such, the directions issued by the High Court are absolutely in consonance with the decisions of this Court in the cases of Ex-Capt. Harish Uppal v. Union of India (2003) 2 SCC 45; Common Cause, A Registered Society v. Union of India (2006) 9 SCC 295 and Krishnakant Tamrakar v. State of M.P. (2018) 17 SCC 27.

6.1 In the case of Ex-Capt. Harish Uppal (supra), this Court has specifically observed and held that the lawyers have no right to go on strike or even token strike or to give a call for strike. It is also further observed that nor can they while holding Vakalat on behalf of clients, abstain from appearing in courts in pursuance of a call for strike or boycott. It is further observed by this Court that it is unprofessional as well as unbecoming for a lawyer to refuse to attend the court even in pursuance of a call for strike or boycott by the Bar Association or the Bar Council. It is further observed that an Advocate is an officer of the court and enjoys a special status in the society; Advocates have obligations and duties to ensure the smooth functioning of the court; they owe a duty to their clients and strikes interfere with the administration of justice. They cannot thus disrupt court proceedings and put interest of their clients in jeopardy.

6.2 While considering the role of the Bar Councils, it is observed in paragraphs 25 and 26 of the aforesaid decision as under:

â25. In the case of Supreme Court Bar Assn. v. Union of India [(1998) 4 SCC 409] it has been held that professional misconduct may also amount to contempt of court (para 21). It has further been held as follows: (SCC pp. 444-46, paras 79-80) â79. An advocate who is found guilty of contempt of court may also, as already noticed, be guilty of professional misconduct in a given case but it is for the Bar Council of the State or Bar Council of India to punish that advocate by either debarring him from practice or suspending his licence, as may be warranted, in the facts and circumstances of each case. The learned Solicitor-General informed us that there have been cases where the Bar Council of India taking note of the contumacious and objectionable conduct of an advocate, had initiated disciplinary proceedings against him and even punished him for âprofessional misconductâ, on the basis of his having been found guilty of committing contempt of court. We do not entertain any doubt that the Bar Council of the State or Bar Council of India, as the case may be, when apprised of the established contumacious conduct of an advocate by the High Court or by this Court, would rise to the occasion, and take appropriate action against such an advocate. Under Article 144 of the Constitution âall authorities, civil and judicial, in the territory of India shall act in aid of the Supreme Courtâ. The Bar Council which performs a public duty and is charged with the obligation to protect the dignity of the profession and maintain professional standards and etiquette is also obliged to act âin aid of the Supreme Courtâ. It must, whenever facts warrant, rise to the occasion and discharge its duties uninfluenced by the position of the contemner advocate. It must act in accordance with the prescribed procedure, whenever its attention is drawn by this Court to the contumacious and unbecoming conduct of an advocate which has the tendency to interfere with due administration of justice. It is possible for the High Courts also to draw the attention of the Bar Council of the State to a case of professional misconduct of a contemner advocate to enable the State Bar Council to proceed in the manner prescribed by the Act and the Rules framed thereunder. There is no justification to assume that the Bar Councils would not rise to the occasion, as they are equally responsible to uphold the dignity of the courts and the majesty of law and prevent any interference in the administration of justice. Learned counsel for the parties present before us do not dispute and rightly so that whenever a court of record records its findings about the conduct of an advocate while finding him guilty of committing contempt of court and desires or refers the matter to be considered by the Bar Council concerned, appropriate action should be initiated by the Bar Council concerned in accordance with law with a view to maintain the dignity of the courts and to uphold the majesty of law and professional standards and etiquette.
Nothing is more destructive of public confidence in the administration of justice than incivility, rudeness or disrespectful conduct on the part of a counsel towards the court or disregard by the court of the privileges of the Bar. In case the Bar Council, even after receiving âreferenceâ from the Court, fails to take action against the advocate concerned, this Court might consider invoking its powers under Section 38 of the Act by sending for the record of the proceedings from the Bar Council and passing appropriate orders. Of course, the appellate powers under Section 38 would be available to this Court only and not to the High Courts. We, however, hope that such a situation would not arise.

80. In a given case it may be possible, for this Court or the High Court, to prevent the contemner advocate to appear before it till he purges himself of the contempt but that is much different from suspending or revoking his licence or debarring him to practise as an advocate. In a case of contemptuous, contumacious, unbecoming or blameworthy conduct of an Advocate-on-Record, this Court possesses jurisdiction, under the Supreme Court Rules itself, to withdraw his privilege to practise as an Advocate-on-Record because that privilege is conferred by this Court and the power to grant the privilege includes the power to revoke or suspend it. The withdrawal of that privilege, however, does not amount to suspending or revoking his licence to practise as an advocate in other courts or tribunals.â Thus a Constitution Bench of this Court has held that the Bar Councils are expected to rise to the occasion as they are responsible to uphold the dignity of courts and majesty of law and to prevent interference in administration of justice. In our view it is the duty of the Bar Councils to ensure that there is no unprofessional and/or unbecoming conduct. This being their duty no Bar Council can even consider giving a call for strike or a call for boycott. It follows that the Bar Councils and even Bar Associations can never consider or take seriously any requisition calling for a meeting to consider a call for a strike or a call for boycott. Such requisitions should be consigned to the place where they belong viz. the waste-paper basket. In case any Association calls for a strike or a call for boycott the State Bar Council concerned and on their failure the Bar Council of India must immediately take disciplinary action against the advocates who give a call for strike and if the Committee members permit calling of a meeting for such purpose, against the Committee members. Further, it is the duty of every advocate to boldly ignore a call for strike or boycott.

26. It must also be noted that courts are not powerless or helpless. Section 38 of the Advocates Act provides that even in disciplinary matters the final appellate authority is the Supreme Court.

Thus even if the Bar Councils do not rise to the occasion and perform their duties by taking disciplinary action on a complaint from a client against an advocate for non-appearance by reason of a call for strike or boycott, on an appeal the Supreme Court can and will. Apart from this, as set out in Ramon Services case [(2001) 1 SCC 118 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 3 : 2001 SCC (L&S) 152] every court now should and must mulct advocates who hold vakalats but still refrain from attending courts in pursuance of a strike call with costs. Such costs would be in addition to the damages which the advocate may have to pay for the loss suffered by his client by reason of his non-appearance.â 6.3 In the aforesaid decision, this Court took note of the resolution dated 29.09.2002 passed by the Bar Council of India, by which it was resolved, inter alia, to constitute the Grievance Redressel Committees at the Taluk/Sub-Division or Tehsil levels, at the District level, High Court and Supreme Court levels.

Thereafter, this Court further observed that merely holding strikes as illegal would not be sufficient in the present-days situation nor would it serve any purpose.

Some concrete joint action is required to be taken by the Bench and the Bar to see that there are no strikes any more. That, thereafter, this Court directed that (a) all the Bar Associations in the country shall implement the resolution dated 29.09.2002 passed by the Bar Council of India, and (b) under Section 34 of the Advocates Act, the High Courts would frame necessary rules so that appropriate actions can be taken against defaulting advocate/advocates.

6.4 Despite the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decisions and even the concern expressed by this Court against the strikes by the lawyers, things did not improve and again the issue of lawyers going on strikes came to be considered in the case of Common Cause, A Registered Society (supra) and this Court in paragraph 4 of that judgment, held as under:

â4. The Constitution Bench has, in Ex Capt. Harish Uppal case [(2003) 2 SCC 45] culled out the law in the following terms: (SCC pp. 64 & 71-74, paras 20-21 & 34-36) â20. Thus the law is already well settled. It is the duty of every advocate who has accepted a brief to attend trial, even though it may go on day to day and for a prolonged period. It is also settled law that a lawyer who has accepted a brief cannot refuse to attend court because a boycott call is given by the Bar Association. It is settled law that it is unprofessional as well as unbecoming for a lawyer who has accepted a brief to refuse to attend court even in pursuance of a call for strike or boycott by the Bar Association or the Bar Council. It is settled law that courts are under an obligation to hear and decide cases brought before them and cannot adjourn matters merely because lawyers are on strike. The law is that it is the duty and obligation of courts to go on with matters or otherwise it would tantamount to becoming a privy to the strike. It is also settled law that if a resolution is passed by Bar Associations expressing want of confidence in judicial officers, it would amount to scandalising the courts to undermine its authority and thereby the advocates will have committed contempt of court. Lawyers have known, at least since Mahabir Singh case [Mahabir Prasad Singh v. Jacks Aviation (P) Ltd., (1999) 1 SCC 37] that if they participate in a boycott or a strike, their action is ex facie bad in view of the declaration of law by this Court. A lawyer's duty is to boldly ignore a call for strike or boycott of court(s). Lawyers have also known, at least since Ramon Services case [Ramon Services (P) Ltd. v Subhash Kapoor, (2001) 1 SCC 118 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 3 : 2001 SCC (L&S) 152] , that the advocates would be answerable for the consequences suffered by their clients if the non-appearance was solely on grounds of a strike call.
21. It must also be remembered that an advocate is an officer of the court and enjoys special status in society. Advocates have obligations and duties to ensure smooth functioning of the court. They owe a duty to their clients. Strikes interfere with administration of justice. They cannot thus disrupt court proceedings and put interest of their clients in jeopardy.

***

34. One last thing which must be mentioned is that the right of appearance in courts is still within the control and jurisdiction of courts. Section 30 of the Advocates Act has not been brought into force and rightly so. Control of conduct in court can only be within the domain of courts. Thus Article 145 of the Constitution of India gives to the Supreme Court and Section 34 of the Advocates Act gives to the High Court power to frame rules including rules regarding condition on which a person (including an advocate) can practise in the Supreme Court and/or in the High Court and courts subordinate thereto. Many courts have framed rules in this behalf. Such a rule would be valid and binding on all. Let the Bar take note that unless self-restraint is exercised, courts may now have to consider framing specific rules debarring advocates guilty of contempt and/or unprofessional or unbecoming conduct, from appearing before the courts. Such a rule if framed would not have anything to do with the disciplinary jurisdiction of the Bar Councils. It would be concerning the dignity and orderly functioning of the courts. The right of the advocate to practise envelops a lot of acts to be performed by him in discharge of his professional duties. Apart from appearing in the courts he can be consulted by his clients, he can give his legal opinion whenever sought for, he can draft instruments, pleadings, affidavits or any other documents, he can participate in any conference involving legal discussions, he can work in any office or firm as a legal officer, he can appear for clients before an arbitrator or arbitrators etc. Such a rule would have nothing to do with all the acts done by an advocate during his practice. He may even file vakalat on behalf of a client even though his appearance inside the court is not permitted. Conduct in court is a matter concerning the court and hence the Bar Council cannot claim that what should happen inside the court could also be regulated by them in exercise of their disciplinary powers. The right to practise, no doubt, is the genus of which the right to appear and conduct cases in the court may be a specie. But the right to appear and conduct cases in the court is a matter on which the court must and does have major supervisory and controlling power. Hence courts cannot be and are not divested of control or supervision of conduct in court merely because it may involve the right of an advocate. A rule can stipulate that a person who has committed contempt of court or has behaved unprofessionally and in an unbecoming manner will not have the right to continue to appear and plead and conduct cases in courts. The Bar Councils cannot overrule such a regulation concerning the orderly conduct of court proceedings. On the contrary, it will be their duty to see that such a rule is strictly abided by. Courts of law are structured in such a design as to evoke respect and reverence to the majesty of law and justice. The machinery for dispensation of justice according to law is operated by the court. Proceedings inside the courts are always expected to be held in a dignified and orderly manner. The very sight of an advocate, who is guilty of contempt of court or of unbecoming or unprofessional conduct, standing in the court would erode the dignity of the court and even corrode its majesty besides impairing the confidence of the public in the efficacy of the institution of the courts. The power to frame such rules should not be confused with the right to practise law. While the Bar Council can exercise control over the latter, the courts are in control of the former. This distinction is clearly brought out by the difference in language in Section 49 of the Advocates Act on the one hand and Article 145 of the Constitution of India and Section 34(1) of the Advocates Act on the other. Section 49 merely empowers the Bar Council to frame rules laying down conditions subject to which an advocate shall have a right to practise i.e. do all the other acts set out above. However, Article 145 of the Constitution of India empowers the Supreme Court to make rules for regulating this practice and procedure of the court including inter alia rules as to persons practising before this Court. Similarly Section 34 of the Advocates Act empowers High Courts to frame rules, inter alia to lay down conditions on which an advocate shall be permitted to practise in courts. Article 145 of the Constitution of India and Section 34 of the Advocates Act clearly show that there is no absolute right to an advocate to appear in a court. An advocate appears in a court subject to such conditions as are laid down by the court. It must be remembered that Section 30 has not been brought into force, and this also shows that there is no absolute right to appear in a court. Even if Section 30 were to be brought into force control of proceedings in court will always remain with the court. Thus even then the right to appear in court will be subject to complying with conditions laid down by courts just as practice outside courts would be subject to conditions laid down by Bar Council of India. There is thus no conflict or clash between other provisions of the Advocates Act on the one hand and Section 34 or Article 145 of the Constitution of India on the other.

35. In conclusion, it is held that lawyers have no right to go on strike or give a call for boycott, not even on a token strike. The protest, if any is required, can only be by giving press statements, TV interviews, carrying out of court premises banners and/or placards, wearing black or white or any colour armbands, peaceful protect marches outside and away from court premises, going on dharnas or relay fasts, etc. It is held that lawyers holding vakalats on behalf of their clients cannot refuse to attend courts in pursuance of a call for strike or boycott. All lawyers must boldly refuse to abide by any call for strike or boycott. No lawyer can be visited with any adverse consequences by the Association or the Council and no threat or coercion of any nature including that of expulsion can be held out. It is held that no Bar Council or Bar Association can permit calling of a meeting for purposes of considering a call for strike or boycott and requisition, if any, for such meeting must be ignored. It is held that only in the rarest of rare cases where the dignity, integrity and independence of the Bar and/or the Bench are at stake, courts may ignore (turn a blind eye) to a protest, abstention from work for not more than one day. It is being clarified that it will be for the court to decide whether or not the issue involves dignity or integrity or independence of the Bar and/or the Bench. Therefore in such cases the President of the Bar must first consult the Chief Justice or the District Judge before advocates decide to absent themselves from court. The decision of the Chief Justice or the District Judge would be final and have to be abided by the Bar. It is held that courts are under no obligation to adjourn matters because lawyers are on strike. On the contrary, it is the duty of all courts to go on with matters on their boards even in the absence of lawyers. In other words, courts must not be privy to strikes or calls for boycotts. It is held that if a lawyer, holding a vakalat of a client, abstains from attending court due to a strike call, he shall be personally liable to pay costs which shall be in addition to damages which he might have to pay his client for loss suffered by him.

36. It is now hoped that with the above clarifications, there will be no strikes and/or calls for boycott. It is hoped that better sense will prevail and self-restraint will be exercised. The petitions stand disposed of accordingly.â The Court also dealt with the role of Bar Councils on the following terms: (SCC pp. 66-68, paras 25-26) â25. In the case of Supreme Court Bar Assn. v. Union of India [(1998) 4 SCC 409 : AIR 1998 SC 1895 : 1998 AIR SCW 1706] it has been held that professional misconduct may also amount to contempt of court (para 21). It has further been held as follows: (SCC pp. 444-46, paras 79-80) â79. An advocate who is found guilty of contempt of court may also, as already noticed, be guilty of professional misconduct in a given case but it is for the Bar Council of the State or Bar Council of India to punish that advocate by either debarring him from practice or suspending his licence, as may be warranted, in the facts and circumstances of each case. The learned Solicitor General informed us that there have been cases where the Bar Council of India taking note of the contumacious and objectionable conduct of an advocate, had initiated disciplinary proceedings against him and even punished him for âprofessional misconductâ, on the basis of his having been found guilty of committing contempt of court. We do not entertain any doubt that the Bar Council of the State or Bar Council of India, as the case may be, when apprised of the established contumacious conduct of an advocate by the High Court or by this Court, would rise to the occasion, and take appropriate action against such an advocate. Under Article 144 of the Constitution âall authorities, civil and judicial, in the territory of India shall act in aid of the Supreme Courtâ. The Bar Council which performs a public duty and is charged with the obligation to protect the dignity of the profession and maintain professional standards and etiquette is also obliged to act âin aid of the Supreme Courtâ. It must, whenever facts warrant, rise to the occasion and discharge its duties uninfluenced by the position of the contemnor advocate. It must act in accordance with the prescribed procedure, whenever its attention is drawn by this Court to the contumacious and unbecoming conduct of an advocate which has the tendency to interfere with due administration of justice. It is possible for the High Courts also to draw the attention of the Bar Council of the State to a case of professional misconduct of a contemnor advocate to enable the State Bar Council to proceed in the manner prescribed by the Act and the rules framed thereunder. There is no justification to assume that the Bar Councils would not rise to the occasion, as they are equally responsible to uphold the dignity of the courts and the majesty of law and prevent any interference in the administration of justice. Learned counsel for the parties present before us do not dispute and rightly so that whenever a court of record records its findings about the conduct of an advocate while finding him guilty of committing contempt of court and desires or refers the matter to be considered by the Bar Council concerned, appropriate action should be initiated by the Bar Council concerned in accordance with law with a view to maintain the dignity of the courts and to uphold the majesty of law and professional standards and etiquette. Nothing is more destructive of public confidence in the administration of justice than incivility, rudeness or disrespectful conduct on the part of a counsel towards the court or disregard by the court of the privileges of the Bar. In case the Bar Council, even after receiving âreferenceâ from the Court, fails to take action against the advocate concerned, this Court might consider invoking its powers under Section 38 of the Act by sending for the record of the proceedings from the Bar Council and passing appropriate orders. Of course, the appellate powers under Section 38 would be available to this Court only and not to the High Courts. We, however, hope that such a situation would not arise.

"JUDGMENT S.N. Aggarwal, J.

1. The appellant, before he was entrapped in a corruption case on 2.11.1994, was working as an Inspector in Delhi Police and was posted as Chowki in-charge at Police Post Sarita Vihar, New Delhi. Entrustment of and investigation of a dowry death case by him turned out to be his nemesis. He was accused of demanding and accepting illegal gratification of Rs.4,500/= from the relatives of the deceased as consideration to help them in early recovery of dowry articles from the house of deceased's in-laws. The appellant was charged and tried by the Special Judge, Delhi for offences under Section 7 and also under Section 13(i)(d) read with Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and after trial was convicted and sentenced on the said charges vide impugned judgment passed by the Special Judge, Delhi on 10.4.2002. He was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for five years with a fine of Rs.5,000/- for each of the offences for which he was convicted. Aggrieved by his conviction and sentence, the appellant has preferred this appeal.

2. The facts of the prosecution case briefly stated are as follows.

3. On 29.4.1994 Ms.Reema, daughter of PW-2 Surinder Singh, was married to Shri Mukesh, resident of Madan Pur Khadar, New Delhi and she died an unnatural death within 4-5 months of her marriage by strangulation in the night intervening 10/11-9-1994. Her father (PW-2) got a criminal case registered against the husband of his deceased daughter, her father-in-law and two sisters- in-law vide FIR no. 294/94 under Sections 498A/304B/34 IPC at Police Station Badar Pur. The investigation of this case was entrusted to the appellant and during investigation the deceased's father (PW-2) contacted the appellant on several dates prior to 2.11.1994, the date on which raid was held by the Central Bureau of Investigation (in short 'CBI') for trapping the appellant in the corruption case on the complaint of PW-1 Surinder Kumar, co-brother of deceased's father (PW-2).

4. As per prosecution case on 2.11.1994 the deceased's father along with his co-brother, Surinder Kumar, had contacted the appellant in the morning at Police Post Sarita Vihar, New Delhi and had requested him for the return of dowry articles of the deceased and also for proper investigation of the case. The appellant at that time was in a hurry and as such, he asked them to contact him at Patiala House Courts, New Delhi. Accordingly, the deceased's father along with his co-brother, Surinder Kumar, contacted the appellant in Patiala House Courts, New Delhi at about 11.00 AM on 2.11.1994. At that time the appellant demanded the bribe of Rs.5,000/= from them in consideration of proper investigation and return of the dowry articles given to the deceased at the time of marriage. PW-1 Surinder Kumar, filed a written complaint dated 2.11.1994 to the Superintendent of Police, CBI (Anti-Corruption Branch), New Delhi alleging therein demand of bribe of Rs.5,000/= by the appellant from him in consideration of proper investigation and return of dowry articles. PW-1 also alleged in his complaint that the appellant had asked him to pay the said amount on the same evening of 2.11.1994 at Police Post Sarita Vihar. The complainant had further alleged in his complaint that he did not want to pay the bribe money and requested the CBI authorities for taking legal action into the matter. On this complaint of the complainant (PW-1), case no. RC-79(A)/94-DLI was registered under Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act on 2.11.1994 and its investigation was entrusted to PW-9 Shri S K Peshin, DSP, CBI (Anti-Corruption Branch, New Delhi).

5. PW-9 Shri S K Peshin after satisfying himself decided to lay a trap by arranging a trap party consisting of himself, two independent witnesses, S/Shri Tahir Hussain and Jitender Kumar Sharma, both from CGO Complex, besides other officers of the CBI. Pre-raid proceedings were conducted in the CBI office. Thereafter as per instructions given during pre-raid proceedings the complainant and shadow witness met the appellant at the Police Post Sarita Vihar in the evening on 2.11.1994. The appellant during conversation accepted the request of the complainant for reducing the bribe amount by Rs.500/=. The appellant directed the complainant to keep the bribe money in his table drawer which the complainant did accordingly. Thereafter the appellant invited them for tea and came out from his office room. When they were going for taking tea, Constable Ashok Kumar met him, who was directed to bring the money kept in his table drawer. Constable Ashok Kumar picked up the money from the table drawer of the appellant as per his directions and by his left hand kept the same in his left side pant pocket and came out from the room of the appellant. Meanwhile, the pre-appointed signal was given by the shadow witness and thereafter the raid party led by PW-9 Shri S K Peshin, immediately rushed to the spot. The appellant on seeing the raid party ran away from the spot. However, Constable Ashok Kumar was caught red handed at the spot. He immediately disclosed that he in compliance of the directions of the appellant had picked up the money from the drawer of his table and the same was kept by him in the left pocket of his pant. The appellant was chased by the officials of the CBI and was brought to the spot. The recovery of the tainted money was made from the left side pant pocket of Constable Ashok Kumar. The appellant as well as Constable Ashok Kumar were arrested from the spot on 2.11.1994 and post-raid proceedings were done at the spot and after the complete investigation of the case, the challan was filed against the appellant.

6. The appellant was charge-sheeted for offences under Section 7 and also under Section 13(i)(d) read with Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act on 5.12.1995. He pleaded not guilty to the charge and was tried by the Special Judge, Delhi. The prosecution examined nine witnesses and they are PW-1 Surinder Kumar (complainant); PW-2 Surinder Singh (deceased's father); PW-3 Jitender Kumar (independent witness); PW-4 R S Gupta (the then Additional Commissioner of Police 'examined to prove the sanction order); PW-5 Tahir Hussain (shadow witness); PW-6 V S Bisaria, Senior Scientific Officer; PW-7 Constable Ashok Kumar [the person from whom bribe money was recovered]; PW-8 Shri Rajiv Kumar Chadha DSP, CBI (2nd I.O. of the case); and PW-9 Shri S K Peshin, DSP, CBI (the initial I.O. of the case).

7. The statement of the appellant was recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C. He also examined two witnesses in his defense and they are DW-1 Constable Vikram Singh and DW-2 Const. Ratan Lal.

8. At the conclusion of the trial and upon consideration of the evidence adduced by the parties, the court below found the appellant guilty of the offences for which he was charged vide impugned judgment and order dated 10.4.2002. Aggrieved by the findings of the court below, the appellant has preferred this appeal.

9. Mr. Sanjay Jain, learned senior counsel, was appointed as amices Curiae to assist the court on behalf of the appellant whereas Ms.Neelam Grover, learned Advocate, appeared on behalf of the CBI/respondent. Learned Senior Counsel has also filed his written submissions which have been carefully gone through by me. I have also gone through the entire record of the trial court as well as the impugned judgment with utmost care.

10. The learned Senior Counsel for the appellant had argued that there are fundamental and other errors in the impugned judgment. He had referred to the testimony of the witnesses on record and by reference to the same, he had argued that there was absolutely no evidence of demand or acceptance of illegal gratification by the appellant and in the absence of such evidence, the court below had committed an error in shifting the onus of proof to explain the charges slapped on him. The evidence pointed out by the learned Counsel and the contentions raised thereon during the course of arguments shall be dealt with at appropriate places hereinafter.

11. On the other hand, Ms.Neelam Grover, learned Advocate for the CBI/respondent, had argued in support of the reasonings for conviction contained in the impugned judgment. She had submitted that though the independent witnesses have turned hostile but their testimony to the extent they have supported the prosecution by their admission of various acts may be looked into as corroborative evidence to support the testimony of the complainant (PW-1) and that of the trap laying Officer (PW-9). She also relied upon the conduct of the appellant of his running away on seeing the raid party and this, according to her, proves the guilt of the appellant of accepting the illegal gratification from the relatives of deceased Reema. Ms.Grover relied upon a judgment of the Supreme Court in State of UP v. Zakaullah 1998 SCC (Cri) 456 in support of her contentions that conviction can be based only on the statement of trap laying Officer de hors other evidence on record. I have given my anxious thought to the rival arguments advanced by the learned Counsel for the parties.

12. All cases of corruption have two important aspects and they are (i) demand and (ii) acceptance. Unless demand and acceptance of illegal gratification by the public servant charged with under the Prevention of Corruption Act are proved by the prosecution beyond doubt, the presumption provided for in Section 20 of the Act cannot be drawn. Three cardinal principles of criminal jurisprudence are well settled and they are as follows:

i) that the onus lies affirmatively on the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and it cannot derive any benefit from weakness or falsity of the defense version while proving its case;

ii) that in a criminal trial the accused must be presumed to be innocent unless he is proved to be guilty; and

iii) that the onus of the prosecution shifts.

13. The Evidence Act also does not contemplate that the accused should prove his case with the same strictness and rigour as the prosecution is required to prove a criminal charge. In fact, from the cardinal principles referred to above, it follows that it is sufficient if the accused is able to prove his case by the standard of preponderance of probabilities as envisaged by Section 5 of the Evidence Act as a result of which he succeeds not because he proves his case to the hilt but because probability of his version throws doubt on the prosecution case.

14. The learned Senior Counsel, who appeared for the appellant, had challenged to the validity of the sanction order passed by the sanctioning authority PW-4, Shri R S Gupta, then Addl. Commissioner of Police, Delhi. He urged that there was complete non-application of mind on the part of the sanctioning authority in granting the sanction for prosecution. In support of his said contention, he placed reliance upon three judgments viz (i) Ganesh Prasad Shukla v. State of Bihar 2000 Crl.L.J. 4841; (ii) Har Bharosey v. State of UP 1988 Crl.L.J. 1122; and (iii) Mohd.Iqbal Ahmed v. State of AP . These judgments on the point of sanction are of no consequence to the contention relating to validity of sanction raised on behalf of the appellant. PW-4 Shri R S Gupta, who at the relevant time was the competent authority to sanction the prosecution, has testified in his testimony during the trial that he had granted sanction for prosecution of the appellant after consideration of all the material placed before him. On perusal of sanction order, Exhibit PW-4/A, it cannot be said that the said order was passed by the sanctioning authority without application of mind as alleged on behalf of the appellant. Hence, the contention of the appellant relating to validity of sanction is found to be without any substance and is, therefore, rejected.

15. Now adverting to the merits of the case, it may be noticed at the outset that the appellant being the Investigating Officer of a dowry death case has heavily relied upon the fact that the relatives of the deceased in the said case had been contacting and threatening him prior to the date of raid held on 2.11.1994 and that he had recorded such threats in his case diary for 25.10.1995 and 29/3.10.1994 (Exhibits DW-1/A, DW-1/B and DW-2/A respectively). The appellant has also submitted in his defense that the father of the deceased (PW- 2) had lodged a complaint against him prior to the date of raid in the Vigilance Department on 19.9.1994 pursuant to which a departmental enquiry was held against him in which after enquiry he was exonerated.

16. The learned Senior Counsel for the appellant had vehemently argued that since the relatives of the deceased had an animosity with the appellant as they were not satisfied with the investigation of dowry death case done by the appellant, they had conceived a plan in connivance with their another relative Mool Chand, a Constable in Delhi Police to falsely implicate the appellant in a corruption case and to cause harm to him.

17. It was further contended by the learned Senior Counsel that neither there was any demand by the appellant nor the bribe money was ever accepted by him from any of the relatives of the deceased. According to him, Constable Mool Chand ('Phoopha' of the deceased) and deceased's father, Surinder Singh (PW-2) were also the members of the raiding party and were present at the time of raid on 2.11.1994 but the prosecution had deliberately withheld Constable Mool Chand from examining him as witness in the case. The contention was that had Constable Mool Chand been examined then he would have unfolded the real truth because it was this man who had kept the money in the drawer at the time of raid.

18. In order to appreciate the above contentions advanced on behalf of the appellant, it would be necessary to refer to the explanation given by the appellant in his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C., where he has given an explanation why he was involved in the present case. The relevant portion of his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. is extracted below:

...In November 1994 I was investigating a criminal dowry death case bearing FIR no. 294/94, PS Badarpur. In this case, Smt.Reema, d/o Surinder Singh PW was the deceased. The case was registered against Mukesh and Ajit Singh, Kumari Bala and Smt.Manju (the husband, father in law and sisters in laws of the deceased). I had arrested Mukesh and Ajit Singh, However, the two ladies, Kumari Bala and Smt.Manju had applied for anticipatory bail. They were granted bail by the court of Sessions on 6.10.94, although I had opposed the bail application. Grant of anticipatory bail to the ladies annoyed the family members of the deceased, including the complainant and other family members of the deceased. Those persons carried impression that bail was granted by the court because of the weak opposition though it was not the fact.

Surinder Singh, the father of the deceased had complained against me to the Vigilance Department and the DCP, South Distt. Both the witnesses had appeared in the inquiry in my presence and their complaint was found without any substance and the same was filed.

Surinder Singh, father of the deceased PW went to the court of ACMM and made allegations against me that I was colluding with the accused persons of dowry death case and the Hon'ble Court recorded the statement of Surinder Singh and his family members.

One Mool Chand Ct., of Delhi Police is related and known person to Surinder Singh and Surinder Kumar, PWs. Mool Chand is not an authorised person. There has been many complaints against his integrity and he is facing departmental inquiry. Criminal cases stands registered against him. He was the person behind the screen to involve me in this case.

On 29.9.1994 the said Mool Chand Const., Surinder Singh and Surinder Kumar came to the Police Post and had threatened me that if I failed to show the return of the dowry articles, they will not allow me to remain in service. I recorded the threat in the case diary dated 29.10.1994. Such threats were also extended to me on 25.10.1994 and I recorded the said threat in my case diary on 25.10.1994. I also recorded the threats in daily diary dated 29/30.10.1994 of PP Sarita Vihar.

19. The above statement of the appellant clearly indicates that prior to the date raid was held on 2.11.1994, the relatives of the deceased had extended threats to the appellant which was recorded by him in his case dairy of 25.10.1994 and 29/30.10.1994. The case diaries containing the threats have been proved by DW-1 and DW-2 as documents Exhibit DW-1/A, DW-1/B and DW-2/A.

20. The learned court below has taken note of the plea of the appellant regarding the threats extended to him by the relatives of deceased recorded in case diary Exhibits DW-1/A, DW-1/B and DW-2/A and in this regard it would be necessary to quote the observations and findings of the court below on this aspect contained in paras 77, 78 and 98 to 102 of the impugned judgment and the same are reproduced hereinbelow:

77. PW-1 conceded during cross examination that he accompanied by PW-2 had visited and met the accused at PP on 29-30/09/94. He however, denied that Const. Mool Chand was with him on the said date. He further denied the suggestion that he (PW2) and Const. Mool Chand had extended threats to the accused on the said dates. He further denied the suggestion that similar threat was given by him and others to the accused on 25.10.1994 and 29.10.1994. He stated that he would not know if accused had made any entry with regard to such threats in the case diary or DD of P.S. It was suggested to him that he was bearing grudge and ill will against the accused and, therefore, had lodged false complaint against him. He denied the said suggestion categorically. Similar suggestions about threats extended on 29-30.09.94, 25.10.94 and 29.10.94 have also been given to PW-2, who also denied the same, also showing ignorance if any entry in this regard had been made by the accused in the case diary or general diary.

78. Accused sought to prove the aforesaid entries in the case diary and daily diary through DW-1 and DW-2. DW-1 Const. Vikram Singh Proved the case diary no. 20 and 21 Ex. DW1/A and Ex. DW1/B pertaining to the dowry death case referred to earlier. DW proved DD No. 8 dated 29-30/09/94 vide copy Ex. DW2/A in the hand of Const. Dhani Ram. Ex. DW1/A is the copy of the case diary dated 25.10.94 while Ex. DW1/B is the copy of case diary of 29.10.94, both purported to be in the hand of the accused. In the case diary Ex. DW1/A the accused, as I.O. of the dowry death case, is shown to have recorded inter alia that outside the Court, Const. Mool Chand and some of his relatives had demanded early restoration of dowry or else they would take suitable action against him Ex. DW1/B. Similarly inter alia also refers to Const. Mool Chand and his relative Surinder Singh (PW-2) having met again outside the Court and having threatened to make a complaint against him before superior officers. In this case diary he also mentioned that the aforesaid persons had gone away extending threats that they would see him and that he would face difficulty in his service.

98. I am not prepared to draw any motive for false implication even from the daily diary entry Ex. DW-2/A, which essentially pertains to report recorded at the instance of the accused as to what had transpired in the Court on 29.10.94. Said entry no where alleges any threats having been extended.

99. Case diaries Ex. DW-1/A and B on the other hand however, parse appears to be fabricated assumbly after involvement in this case. Interestingly, the date and place of occurrence mentioned in the said case diary is described as 10.11.94, even though the case diaries purport to have been recorded on 25.10.94 and 29.10.94. The case diary, even otherwise, was a record within the control of the accused. It is quite apparent that he fabricated these case diaries so as to create ground of defense in the case in hand. Assuming such threats had been extended as are fount reflected in these case diaries, there is no explanation whatsoever on the part of the accused as to what steps did he take to ensure that the threats were not translated into action.

100. It is inconceivable that a police officer of the rank of Inspector would sit quiet even on hearing threats from a police official of as low a rank as a Constable. If such incidents as alleged by the accused actually happened they amounted to serious misconduct, even penal offences, on the part amongst others, of constable Mool Chand. There was nothing stopping the accused from initiating action against him under the law, or through the department by way of reports to his superiors. There is nothing on record to indicate any such initiative on the part of the accused.

101. Noticeably, the accused has himself not entered the witness box to vouch safe the acts pertaining to alleged threats received by him on 25.10.94 and 29.10.94. The mere reference to the case diaries through DW1 cannot result in the contents thereof being held even remotely being proved. The fact that accused avoided entering the witness box to depose to such effect rather shows he would not take the risk of facing inconvenient questions in the nature mentioned above, rendering the defense plea further suspect. 102 All said and done, I am of the considered opinion that the theory of threats by the Complainant side has been invented on the basis of record that has been fabricated. In these circumstances Chander Bhan v. Stated (as relied upon by defense) is distinguishable on facts.

21. A reading of the findings of the court below on the aspect of case diary ( Exhibits DW-1/A, DW-1/B and DW-2/A) would clearly indicate an erroneous approach on the part of the trial court in shifting the onus of proof from prosecution to the accused. I am of the view that the learned court below ought to have considered the facts of the case in its entirety while adverting to the controversy as to whether or not the appellant was guilty of committing the offences complained of. The Apex Court in the case of Rabindra Kumar Dey v. State of Orissa had observed as under:

It is true that under Section 105 of the Evidence Act the onus of proving exceptions mentioned in the Indian Penal Code lies on the accused, but this Section does not at all indicate the nature and standard of poof required. The Evidence Act does not contemplate that the accused should prove his case with the same strictness and rigour as the Prosecution is required to prove a criminal charge. In fact, from the cardinal principles referred to above, it follows that, it is sufficient if the accused is able to prove his case by the standard of preponderance of probabilities as envisaged by Section 5 of the Evidence Act as a result of which he succeeds not because he proves his case to the hilt, but because probability of the version given by him throws doubt on the prosecution case and, therefore, the prosecution cannot be said to have established the charge beyond reasonable doubt. In other words, the mode of proof by standard of benefit of doubt, is not applicable to the accused, where he is called upon to prove his case or to prove the exceptions of the Indian Penal Code on which he seeks to rely. It is sufficient for the defense to give a version which competes in probability with the prosecution version, for that would be sufficient to throw suspicion on the prosecution case entailing its rejection by the court. This aspect is no longer res integra but is concluded by several authorities of this Court.

22. The learned court below was obliged to consider and weigh the defense of the appellant in the light of the above judgment of the Apex Court on the aspect of standard of proof required from the accused to prove his defense. In my view, the learned trial court went wrong in drawing an adverse presumption and in not believing the entries contained in the case diary, Exhibits DW-1/A, DW-1/B and DW-2/A, on the premise that the appellant himself did not enter the witness box. Such an approach was wholly erroneous in view of the admission made by the relatives of the deceased (PW-1 and PW-2) in the course of their testimony in the trial that they had contacted the appellant on several dates prior to the date raid was held on 2.11.1994. Further more, the view taken by the learned trial court that the entries contained in the case diaries, Exhibits DW-1/A, DW-1/B and DW-2/A, are fabricated documents only because the date of 10.11.1994 is mentioned there in the column of date of incident. It seems that the learned court below has mistaken itself in taking the said date for construing the case diaries as fabricated documents. This date of 10.11.194 mentioned in the above mentioned case diaries actually relates to the date of incident of dowry death case, which took place during the intervening night of 10/11.9.1994 and it seems that the month of November instead of September mentioned in the said case diaries was on account of pen-slip. The entries contained in the above case diaries have been proved in the testimony of defense witnesses as Exhibits DW-1/A, DW-1/B and DW-2/A and there is nothing in their cross examination to have a slightest doubt on their veracity. Hence, I am of the view that the learned court below has wrongly ignored the plea of past animosity attempted to be proved by the appellant during trial.

23. PW-1 Surinder Kumar, is the 'Mausa' of the deceased and PW-2 Surinder Singh, is the deceased's father. Both these witnesses have candidly admitted in their evidence during trial that they along with their another relative Constable Mool Chand had contacted the appellant in relation to progress of the investigation on several dates prior to the date raid was held on 2.11.1994. PW-1 and PW-2 have further admitted in their evidence that they had lodged a complaint against the appellant on 19.9.1994 in the Vigilance Department and that they had also made complaints against him to the Commissioner of Police as well as to the ACMM as they were not satisfied with the progress of investigation in the dowry death case relating to unnatural death of daughter of PW-2 Surinder Singh. The complaint dated 19.9.1994 made by the deceased's father (PW-2) against the appellant in the Vigilance Department of Delhi Police through Commissioner of Police is Exhibit as PW-2/D-2 and a perusal of the said complaint reveals that deceased's father had made a complaint against the appellant even about his integrity also. This complaint admittedly was made before the date of raid i.e. 2.11.1994.

24. On the face of the above admissions made by PW-1 and PW-2 in their testimony before the court below in the present case and particularly, in view of the written complaint made by PW-2, Exhibit PW-2/D-2, it does not stand to reason how the court below could have doubted the plea of the appellant regarding animosity between the complainant and the appellant prior to the date of raid. Since the appellant has proved through cogent evidence that the relatives of the deceased were entertaining hostility against him prior to the date of raid, it was the bounden duty of the court below to have scanned the entire evidence placed before it carefully giving the same weightage to the defense plea as given to the prosecution witnesses. In this backdrop the plea of the appellant about his false implication could not have been completely ruled out till it was proved that he had made a demand and accepted illegal gratification from the complainant to show some favor to him in dowry death case. As per case of the prosecution, the bribe was demanded by the appellant from PW-1 and PW-2 as consideration for return of dowry articles of the deceased. Both PW-1 and PW-2 have admitted in their respective testimony that they never made any demand for return of dowry articles prior to the date of raid either in the FIR or by way of an application to any other authority. As such, the consideration for which bribe was allegedly demanded by the appellant was completely non-existent. It is difficult to believe that a person would demand bribe from his tormentors, particularly, when he knew full well that they were after his blood prior to the date of alleged demand. Such a thing is against normal human behavior which could not have been lost sight of by the trial court while analysing the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. It was the duty of the court below to have seen whether the essential pre-requisites of a corruption case i.e. demand and acceptance have been proved beyond doubt or not but this duty, in my view, seems to have not been discharged by the learned trial court as per settled legal norms for proving a criminal case of corruption.

25. It is revealed from the record that the independent public witnesses associated with the raid have not supported the prosecution version. These public witnesses are PW-3 Jitender Kumar and PW-5 Tahir Hussain. They both were declared hostile. These public witnesses had nothing to do either with the prosecution case or with the defense of the appellant. If their testimony is analyzed in the right perspective, it may be seen that both of these witnesses have given a version that would support the defense plea of the appellant instead of supporting the prosecution version. The observation of the court below that these public witnesses were won over by the appellant does not seem to be correct in view of testimony of other witnesses on record. PW-7 Constable Ashok Kumar was caught red handed during raid and as per the prosecution case, the tainted money was allegedly recovered from his possession. There is no cogent evidence on record to show recovery of tainted money from PW-7 Constable Ashok Kumar. Admittedly as per case of the prosecution, PW-7 Constable Ashok Kumar was arrested from the spot on 02.11.94 and he was bailed out along with the appellant after 3-4 days of his arrest. Though PW-7 Constable Ashok Kumar was initially a suspect but later on the prosecution chose to make him its witness instead of putting him in the column of accused persons. The prosecution has not given any explanation why PW-7 Constable Ashok Kumar from whom tainted money was allegedly recovered was not made a accused in the case. Be that as it may PW-7 Constable Ashok Kumar as a prosecution witness has not at all supported the prosecution version in his testimony. He was also declared hostile and was cross examined by the learned Prosecutor. In his cross-examination except giving suggestions to him which were picked from his statement under Section 161 Cr. P.C., no effort was made by the prosecution to dig out the truth from him or to know how the tainted money came in his possession. PW-7 Constable Ashok Kumar has clearly stated in his testimony during trial that he was not instructed by the appellant to remove the tainted money from his table drawer. In fact this witness has completely denied recovery of tainted money from his possession. As such it may be seen that three important witnesses of the prosecution namely PW-3, PW-5 and PW-7 were hostile to its case.

26. The tainted money was admittedly not recovered during raid from the possession of the appellant. It is not the case of the prosecution that the bribe money was recovered by it from the appellant. PW-9 S.K. Peshin who was the trap laying officer was admittedly neither a witness to the demand of bribe allegedly made by the appellant from the relatives of the deceased at Patiala House Courts on 02.11.94 or to the acceptance of the bribe money by him. PW-9 in his testimony during trial has only proved the pre-raid proceedings and the post-raid proceedings. As per his testimony, he along with his other members of the raid party rushed towards the appellant on receiving pre-appointed signal given by the shadow witness PW-5 Tahir Hussain. PW-9 has further deposed that he was told by the complainant (PW-1) and the shadow witness PW-5 Tahir Hussain that they had heard the appellant instructing PW-7 Constable Ashok Kumar to remove the tainted money from his table drawer. This part of the testimony of PW-9 is hit by rule of hear-say and is therefore inadmissible in evidence. Further more, the shadow witness PW-5 Tahir Hussain has not supported the version of PW-9 S.K. Peshin that he had told him having heard the appellant giving instructions to PW-7 Constable Ashok Kumar to remove the tainted money from his table drawer. Thus, neither demand nor acceptance of illegal gratification is proved from the testimony of trap laying officer (PW-9).

27. Now we are left only with the testimony of PW-1 and PW-2 who both are the relatives of the deceased. PW-1 Surinder Kumar is the Mausa of the deceased whereas PW-2 Surinder Singh is the deceased's father. They are both interested witnesses in the sense that their paramount interest lied in the success of corruption case initiated by them against the appellant. Though PW-1 and PW-2 are interested witnesses but their testimony cannot be discredited merely on the ground that they are interested witnesses. In case the testimony of interested witnesses is credit worthy, the conviction can still be based on their uncorroborated testimony.

28. In Jaswant Singh v.State of Punjab Air 1973 SC 707 it was held by the Supreme Court that in a bribery case the complainant is an interested witness and his evidence must be considered with great caution and it can be accepted when this is corroborated by other evidence adduced by the prosecution.

29. In view of the latest trend of the Supreme Court in its judgments particularly in State of UP v. Zakaullah's case (supra), the complainant's evidence does not require any corroboration and the court can act upon the testimony of the complainant provided the same is trustworthy to be acted upon.

30. In the light of the above judgments of the Supreme Court, what we have now to see is whether the testimony of PW-1 and PW-2 being the relatives of the deceased is credit-worthy or not and if the same is found to be credit-worthy, whether it proves the essential ingredients of offence of corruption for which the appellant had faced trial.

31. PW-2 Surinder Singh is the father of the deceased Reema. The contention of the learned senior counsel who appeared on behalf of the appellant was that this witness along with his other relative Constable Mool Chand was present throughout the raid and it was contended that even the tainted money was kept in the drawer of the appellant by Constable Mool Chand but for reasons best known to the prosecution, their presence during raid was concealed from the Court. In order to establish this plea, the learned senior counsel had referred to the testimony of PW-2 Surinder Singh and had also relied upon the statement of this witness Ex. DC recorded during departmental proceedings held against the appellant on the complaint of the deceased's father. It was contended that PW-2 Surinder Singh in his testimony before the Court has testified that he was not present at the time of raid and had left for his village from the office of his co-brother Surinder Kumar at Maharani Bagh, New Delhi. It was pointed out that this stand taken by PW-2 during trial of the present case is in complete contradiction to the stand taken by him in his statement Ex. DC during departmental proceedings wherein he has stated that he was very much present during raid and also that the bribe money was accepted by the appellant in his presence. The factual aspect in regard to the above pointed out during arguments cannot be said to be without substance. What learned senior counsel had contended on the above factual aspect is in fact born out from the record of this case. It seems that the above material contradiction regarding presence or absence of deceased's father during raid was completely overlooked by the court below. The fact that the deceased's father (PW-2) was present with the raiding party at the time of raid is also born out by his answer to question No. 9 during departmental proceedings and the same is extracted below:

Q.no. 9. Whether any formalities regarding preparation of papers was done at the Police Post before proceeding to the CBI office Ans. It was not done at least in my presence. I was made to sign certain papers in the CBI office.

32. The above answer given by the deceased's father to question No. 9 during departmental proceedings clearly implies that though he was present during raid but the formalities regarding the preparation of papers were completed in the CBI Office and not at the spot. In case the deceased's father was present during raid, why the prosecution withheld his presence creates a serious doubt on the story of the prosecution. Even the presence of Constable Mool Chand who was also a close relative of the deceased has also been established through the testimony of PW-3, PW-5 and PW-7. The relevant portions of their testimony in their cross- examination are extracted below:

PW3, Jitender Kumar, stated as follows:

Treated notes were thereafter handed over to the Mool Chand or complainant Surinder Kumar. I am not sure about it. Complainant was directed to hand over the tainted notes to the accused in the event of specific demand. Mool Chand was directed to act as a shadow witness and tried to see the transaction as well as hear the conversation. He was further directed to give signal to the raiding party by placing his hands over his hairs in the event of acceptance of bribe by accused. We left CBI office at about 6:00pm. And proceeded towards Police Post Sarita Vihar. Official vehicles were parked at a distance of half kms. From the Police Post and we all got down. Thereafter Surinder Kumar, Tahir Hussain, Mool Chand and father of the girl proceeded towards the Police Post Sarita Vihar. We three remaining members of the raiding party took position outside the Police Post. 20/25 minutes later, Mool Chand came out of the Police Post and gave signal by placing his hand over his head.... It is incorrect to suggest that at time no person by the name of Mool Chand was present in the office of Shri S.K. Peshin.... I know Mool Chand because one person during the pre-raid proceedings was introduced to me as Mool Chand. Said Mool Chand of medium built. It is incorrect to suggest that no person with the name of Mool Chand was present in the CBI office nor any such person was introduced to me.... I had conversation with Mool Chand on the date of raid. During the conversation I came to know that said Mool Chand was Constable in Delhi Police and that he was related to complainant Surinder Kumar.

PW-5, Tahir Hussain in this regard as follows:

On 2.11.94 I visited CBI office along with Jitender Kumar, UDC at around 4:00 PM pr 4:30 pm on the instructions of my senior officer. There I met some CBI officials. Complainant was already present there and he have his name as Mool Chand.... Said GC notes were handed over to the complainant Mool Chand.... It is incorrect Mool Chand told me in the way to PP Sarita Vihar that he is the Constable of Delhi Police. Mool Chand and the complainant had gone into the room of accused S.K. Sharma.",cr
"S.NAGAMUTHU.J., Selvi. Sujatha, the detenue, is aged 17 years. She is the daughter of the petitioner. Previously, she was studying in a Higher Secondary School at Tiruvallur and was staying at the house of the petitioner's sister. On 08.06.2011 at about 4.30 p.m. She had gone to a local temple, but she did not return thereafter. The petitioner learnt that the 2nd respondent along with others had kidnapped her. He preferred a complaint in this regard before the 1st respondent on 20.06.2011 on which a case in Crime No.309 of 2011 for offence under Section 366(A) of IPC has been registered. Alleging that the minor detenue was kept illegally by the kidnappers, the petitioner filed the present habeas corpus petition.

2. The 3rd respondent is the father of the 2nd respondent. When this habeas corpus petition came up for hearing before a Division Bench, on 28.07.2011, the Division Bench ordered notice to the respondents. In pursuance of the same, the minor detenue appeared before the Division Bench on 01.08.2011 and filed an affidavit to the effect that she had fallen in love with the 2nd respondent for quite some time and that on knowing the same, her parents started arranging for her marriage with her maternal uncle much against her wish. Therefore, according to her, on 08.06.2011, she left the parental home on her own accord and on 12.07.2011, she married the 2nd respondent. The said marriage has been accepted by the 2nd respondent and his other family members and she is not illegally detained by anybody, she had stated.

3. Based on the above affidavit of the minor detenue, the learned counsel appearing for the respondents 2 and 3 contended before the Division Bench that since the detenue was in a position to make intelligent preference to go with the 2nd respondent and since after the said marriage, the 2nd respondent is the legal guardian, the detenue should be set at liberty to go along with the 2nd respondent.

4. But, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner opposed the same on several grounds projecting the welfare of the minor detenue. Having considered the rival submissions, the Division Bench presided over by Mr.Justice C.Nagappan directed the minor detenue to be kept in a Government Children's Home. The learned counsel heavily placed reliance on the judgment of another Division Bench of this Court in G.Saravanan v. The Commissioner of Police, Trichy City and others , 2011 - 2 - L.W. (Crl.) 114 wherein the Division Bench has held that a child marriage is neither void nor voidable and the same is valid and so, the husband of the child in marriage is entitled for custody of the child / wife . The Division Bench had doubt about the correctness of the said conclusion. The Division Bench also took note of the judgments in Saraswathi Ammal V. Dhanakoti Ammal, (1924) 47 MLJ 614 [Madras High Court], Seema Devi @ Simran Kaur v. State of Himachal Pradesh, (1928) 2 Crimes 68 (Himachal Pradesh High Court), Neetu Singh v. The State, (1999) II AD Delhi 37 [Delhi High Court], Ravikumar v. State , 124 (2005) DLT 1 [Delhi High Court], Manish Singh v. State, AIR 2006 DELHI 37 [Delhi High Court], Association for Social Justice and Research v. Union of India, [decided on 13.05.2010 by Delhi High Court], Latori Chamar v. State of Madhya Pradesh, [decided on 10.01.2007 by Madhya Pradesh High Court], Avinash v. State of Karnataka, CDJ 2011 KAR HC 373 [Karnataka High Court] and Jitendar Kumar Sharma v. State [decided on 11.10.2010 by Delhi High Court]. In Association for Social Justice and Research Case cited supra , a Division Bench of Delhi High Court observed that the issue relating to custody of a minor girl who has been married has been referred to a Full Bench for decision in Lajja Devi's case. We are informed that the said reference has not been so far decided by a larger Bench of the Delhi High Court. But, without noticing the same, a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court in Jitendar Kumar Sharma v. State and another reported in 2010 INDLAW DEL 1904, allowed the minor girl to go with the husband. In this background the Division Bench presided over by Mr.Justice C.Nagappan has referred this matter for answering the following questions:-

(1) Whether a marriage contracted by a person with a female of less than 18 years could be said to be valid marriage and the custody of the said girl be given to the husband [if he is not in custody]?

(2) Whether a minor can be said to have reached the age of discretion and thereby walk away from the lawful guardianship of her parents and refuse to go in their custody?

(3) If yes, can she be kept in the protective custody of the State?

(4) Whether in view of the provisions of Juvenile Justice [Care and Protection of Children] Act, 2000, a minor girl, who claims to have solemnized her marriage with another person would not be a juvenile in conflict with law and whether in violation of the procedure mandated by the Juvenile Justice [Care and Protection of Children] Act, 2000, the Court dealing with a Writ of Habeas Corpus , has the power to entrust the custody of the minor girl to a person, who contracted the marriage with the minor girl and thereby committed an office punishable under Section 18 of the Hindu Marriage Act and Section 9 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 ? and (5) Whether the principles of Sections 17 and 19(a) of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, could be imported to a case arising out of the alleged marriage of a minor girl, admittedly in contravention of the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act?

Having considered the above, the Hon'ble The Chief Justice has constituted this Full Bench and that is how, the matter is before us.

5. When this matter came up for hearing before this Bench on 19.08.2011, the respondents 2 and 3 in the HCP filed a miscellaneous petition in M.P.No.1 of 2011 seeking an interim order to take the detenue to P.B. College of Engineering, Irrungattukottai, for admission in B.Tch course. Accordingly, this court passed an interim order and permitted her to be taken to PB College of Engineering for admission. The minor detenue was thus admitted in the College. The detenue was also produced before this Court. On enquiries, she informed the court that she was not willing to go with her parents and she was ready to attend the college from the college hostel. Having considered the submissions made and having regard to the interest of the minor detenue, this court directed the minor detenue to be kept in the Government Kellys Home for Children, Chennai and to allow her to go to the college every day, however, with the help of a women police constable. Accordingly, she was attending the college.

6. Again on 07.09.2011 when the matter was listed , the learned counsel appearing for the respondents 2 and 3 submitted that the detenue found it very difficult to stay in Government Home for Children, Kellys, Chennai as she was facing lot of difficulties. Thus, she wanted the detenue to be allowed to stay in the hostel of the college. Mr.P.N.Prakash, learned counsel representing P.B. College of Engineering submitted that the college management was having an apprehension to allow her to stay in the hostel in view of certain untoward incidents taken place at the time of remitting the fees in the college. Ms.Geetha Ramaseshan the learned counsel appearing for a Non-Governmental Organization known as ""TULIR"" a voluntary organisation came forward to keep the detenue in the home known as ""Mariyala"" situated at Pidariyar Koil Street, George Town, Chennai. In the larger interest of the detenue and on considering the submissions made by the learned counsel on either side, the detenue was ordered to be accommodated in the said home namely Mariyala until further orders and the detenue was permitted to attend the college from there. The Assistant Commissioner of Police was directed to nominate a woman police constable to accompany the detenue to the college everyday in order to ensure her safety. Accordingly, now she is staying in the home.

7. In this background, this habeas corpus petition was heard at length. Mr.R.John Sathyan , learned counsel for the petitioner, Mrs.Sudha Ramalingam, learned counsel for the respondents 2 and 3 and Mr.M.Maharaja, learned Additional Public Prosecutor advanced elaborate arguments. Taking note of the importance of the questions referred to this Full Bench , we requested Mr.P.N.Prakash , the learned counsel to assist this court as Amicus Curiae and accordingly, he rendered assistance.

8. Since the parties to the marriage in this case are admittedly Hindus, we confine our discussion in the context of the laws applicable to Hindus alone. Now let us commence our task to answer the questions under reference.

9. To trace the history of the child marriages, we have to state that until the introduction of the ""Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929"" child marriages were prevalent in India among Hindus in abundance and there was no mechanism even to discourage the same. Such marriages were all recognized as valid. But, the ill-effects of the child marriage was taken note of even during the colonial period which prompted the law being brought into force to restrain the child marriages by enacting the ""Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929"". A reference to the said Act would go to show that the said Act, was enacted to carry forward the reformists movement of prohibiting child marriages. While it made a marriage in contravention of the provisions of the Act punishable, simultaneously it did not render the marriage void. It needs to be emphasized that voidness of marriages is statutorily provided and the same is not to be readily inferred. Thus even after the advent of the Child Marriage Restraint Act such marriages were recognized as valid marriages.

10. Subsequently, the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 came into being with effect from 18.05.1955. Section 4 of the said Act states that save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, any other law in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall cease to have effect in so far as it is inconsistent with any of the provisions contained in this Act. But, no inconsistency could be noticed between the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and that of the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929. Both the Acts coexist.

11. Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act, as it was originally brought into force , contained six clauses as follows:-

A marriage may be solemnized between any two Hindus, if the following conditions are fulfilled, namely :

(i) neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage;

(ii) at the time of the marriage, neither party

(a) is incapable of giving a valid consent to it in consequence of unsoundness of mind; or

(b) though capable of giving a valid consent, has been suffering from mental disorder of such a kind or to such an extent as to be unfit for marriage and the procreation of children; or

(c) has been subject to recurrent attacks of insanity;

(iii) the bridegroom has completed the age of [twenty-one years] and the bride the age of [eighteen years] at the time of the marriage;

[emphasis supplied]

(iv) the parties are not within the degrees of prohibited relationship, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two;

(v) the parties are not sapindas of each other, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two.

(vi) Where the bride has not completed the age of eighteen years, the consent of the guardian in the marriage if any has been obtained for the marriage. [The sub clause (vi) was repealed by the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1978 w.e.f. 01.10.1978]

12. The effect of violation of the conditions enumerated in Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act are dealt with in Sections 11 and 12 of the Act. According to Section 11 , any marriage solemnized after the commencement of the Act shall be null and void and may, on a petition presented by either party thereto, against the other party, be so declared by a decree of nullity if it contravenes any one or more of the conditions specified in clauses (i), (iv) and (v) of section 5.

13. Similarly, Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act speaks of a voidable marriage which reads as follows:-

(1) Any marriage solemnized, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be voidable and may be annulled by a decree of nullity on any of the following grounds, namely :

(a) that the marriage has not been consummated owing to the impotence of the respondent; or

(b) that the marriage is in contravention of the condition specified in clause (ii) of Section 5; or

(c) that the consent of the petitioner, or where the consent of the guardian in marriage of the petitioner [was required under Section 5 as it stood immediately before the commencement of the Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Act, 1978 (2 of 1978)] the consent of such guardian was obtained by force [or by fraud as to the nature of the ceremony or as to any material fact or circumstance concerning the respondent]; or

(d) that the respondent was at the time of the marriage pregnant by some person other than the petitioner.

(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), no petition for annulling a marriage

(a) on the ground specified in clause (c) of sub-section (1), shall be entertained if

(i) the petition presented more than one year after the force had ceased to operate or, as the case may be, the fraud had been discovered; or

(ii) the petitioner has, with his or her full consent, lived with the other party to the marriage as husband or wife after the force had ceased to operate or, as the case may be, the fraud had been discovered;

(b) on the ground specified in clause (d) of sub-section (1) shall be entertained unless the court is satisfied

(i) that the petitioner was at the time of the marriage ignorant of the facts alleged;

(ii) that proceedings have been instituted in the case of a marriage solemnized before the commencement of this Act within one year of such commencement and in the case of marriages solemnized after such commencement within one year from the date of the marriage; and

(iii) that marital intercourse with the consent of the petitioner has not taken place since the discovery by the petitioner of the existence of [the said ground]""

14. A close reading of these two provisions would go to show that a marriage solemnized in violation of sub section (iii) of Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act has not been declared either as void or voidable. The marriage which falls within the ambit of Section 11 has been held to be void from its very inception [vide Yamunabai Anantrao Adhav Vs. Anantrao Shivram Adhav, A.I.R. 1988 S.C. 644]. So far as a voidable marriage as provided in Section 12 of the Act is concerned , the said marriage may be annulled by a decree of nullity on any one or more of the grounds enumerated thereunder. Since the Hindu Marriage Act as well as the Child Marriage Restraint Act do not declare a marriage of a minor either as void or voidable, such a child marriage was treated all along as valid . There were number of judicial pronouncements to this effect. In this legal scenario, The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act also provided that the husband of a minor wife is her natural guardian.

15. While so, it was felt that the Child Marriage Restraint Act, did not achieve the desired result. Despite the punishment provided for child marriages, and despite making the punishment more stringent, the menace of child marriage could not be completely eradicated. There were demands from various quarters for making an effective law for this purpose. The Law Commission also recommended for such a law. Responding to the same, at last, with effect from 10.01.2007, ""The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006"" was brought into force thereby repealing The Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929. As envisaged in Section 1 of the said Act, it extends to the whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir; and it applies also to all citizens of India; provided that nothing contained in this Act shall apply to the Renoncants of the Union territory of Pondicherry. It is manifestly clear that this Act is secular in nature which has crossed all barriers of personal laws. Thus, irrespective of the personal laws, under this Act, child marriages are prohibited.

16. The term ""child"" has been defined in Section 2 (a) of the said Act which states that ""child"" means a person who, if a male, has not completed twenty-one years of age, and if a female, has not completed eighteen years of age. This provision is in pari materia with sub section (iii) of section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act. One of the important and salient features of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 is that Section 3 of the Act declares that every child marriage, whether solemnized before or after the commencement of the said Act shall be voidable at the option of the contracting party who was a child at the time of the marriage; provided that petition for annulling the child marriage by a decree of nullity may be filed in the District Court only by the contracting party to the marriage who was a child at the time of the marriage. Section 3 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act reads as follows:-

""3. Child marriages to be voidable at the option of contracting party being a child:- (1) Every child marriage, whether solemnised before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be voidable at the option of the contracting party who was a child at the time of the marriage :

Provided that a petition for annulling a child marriage by a decree of nullity may be filed in the district court only by a contracting party to the marriage who was a child at the time of the marriage.

(2) If at the time of filing a petition, the petitioner is a minor, the petition may be filed through his or her guardian or next friend along with the Child Marriage Prohibition Officer.

(3) The petition under this section may be filed at any time but before the child filing the petition completes two years of attaining majority.

(4) While granting a decree of nullity under this section, the district court shall make an order directing both the parties to the marriage and their parents or their guardians to return to the other party, his or her parents or guardian, as the case may be, the money, valuables, ornaments and other gifts received on the occasion of the marriage by them from the other side, or an amount equal to the value of such valuables, ornaments, other gifts and money :

Provided that no order under this section shall be passed unless the concerned parties have been given notices to appear before the district court and show cause why such order should not be passed.""

17. This is a great departure made by this Act from the Hindu Marriage Act. When the Prohibition of the Child Marriage Act , 2006 was enacted, the parliament was aware of the provisions of Sections 5, 11, 12 and 18 of the Hindu Marriage Act. By declaring that the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act shall apply to all citizens , the parliament has intended to allow the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act to override the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act to the extent of inconsistencies between these two enactments. This is manifest from the statement of Objects and Reasons of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 which read as follows:-

"" The Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929 was enacted with a view to restraining solemnisation of child marriages. The Act was subsequently amended in 1949 and 1978 in order, inter alia, to raise the age limit of the male and female persons for the purpose of marriage. The Act, though restrains solemnisation of child marriages yet it does not declare them to be void or invalid. The solemnisation of child marriages is punishable under the Act.

2. There has been a growing demand for making the provisions of Act more effective and the punishment thereunder more stringent so as to eradicate or effectively prevent the evil practice of solemnisation of child marriages in the country. This will enhance the health of children and the status of women. The National Commission for women in its Annual Report for the year 1995-96 recommended that the Government should appoint Child Marriage Prevention Officers immediately. It further recommend that (i) the punishment provided under the Act should be made more stringent; (ii) marriages performed in contravention of the Act should be made void; and (iii) the offences under the Act should be made congnizable.

3. The National Human Rights Commission undertook a comprehensive review of the existing Act and made recommendations for comprehensive amendments therein vide its Annual Report 2001-2002. The Central Government, after consulting the State Governments and Union Territory Administrations on the recommendations of the National Commission for Women and the National Human Rights Commission, had decided to accept almost all the recommendations and give effect to them by repealing and re-enacting the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929.

18. A close reading of the above objects and reasons of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act,would keep things beyond any pale of doubt that the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act is a special enactment for the purpose of effectively preventing the evil practice of solemnisation of child marriages and also to enhance the health of the child and the status of women, whereas , the Hindu Marriage Act is a general law regulating the Hindu marriages. Therefore, the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, being a special law, will have overriding effect over the Hindu Marriage Act to the extent of any inconsistency between these two enactments. In view of the said settled position, undoubtedly, Section 3 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act will have overriding effect over the Hindu Marriage Act.

19. But, the Division Bench which decided the case in G.Saravanan v. The Commissioner of Police, Trichy City and others , 2011 - 2 - L.W. (Crl.) 114 held that such a child marriage solemnised between two Hindus is neither void nor voidable, but valid. After having referred to Section 5, 11, 12 and 18 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the Division Bench in Saravanan's case has held as follows:-

""15. A Hindu marriage which is not a void marriage under HMA would continue to be such, provided the provisions of Section 12 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 are not attracted. In the case in hand, none of the circumstances specified in Section 12 arises.

16. Therefore, the marriage between these two is not void or voidable or invalid and it would also be unaffected by the provisions of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006""

[Emphasis supplied]

20. We find it hard to agree with the above above observation of the Division Bench for, the marriage of a child [minor girl] shall certainly be affected by Section 3 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act and thus the said child marriage is voidable. After extracting Section 3 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act , the Division Bench, in paragraph 18 & 19 has held as follows:-

""18. The above provision makes it very clear that irrespective of whether the child marriage is voidable or not under Personal Law, makes every child marriage voidable at the option of a party to the marriage, who was a child at the time of marriage. The important aspect of this provision is that a petition for annulling a child marriage by a decree of nullity can be filed only by a party to the marriage, who was a child at the time of marriage. Nobody other than a party to the marriage can petition for annulment of the marriage.

19. In the instant case, the marriage of the detenue with the petitioner is neither void nor voidable nor invalid under both Act, HMA and the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 as no petition was filed under Section 3 of Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 by the detenue who is still a minor......""

[Emphasis supplied]

21. From a reading of the above, we infer that probably the Division Bench was of the view that if only a petition is filed under Section 3 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act , the said marriage will be voidable. We are unable to agree with the said conclusion arrived at by the Division Bench. In our considered opinion, the marriage shall remain voidable [vide Section 3] and the said marriage shall be subsisting until it is avoided by filing a petition for a decree of nullity by the child within the time prescribed in Section 3 (3) of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act. If, within two years from the date of attaining eighteen years in the case of a female and twenty-one years in the case of a male, a petition is not filed before the District Court under Section 3 (1) of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act for annulling the marriage, the marriage shall become a full-fledged valid marriage. Similarly, after attaining eighteen years of age in the case of female, or twenty-one years of age in the case of a male, if she or he elects to accept the marriage, the marriage shall become a full-fledged valid marriage. Until such an event of acceptance of the marriage or lapse of limitation period as provided in Section 12 (3) occurs, the marriage shall continue to remain as a voidable marriage. If the marriage is annulled as per Section 3 (1) of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, the same shall take effect from the date of marriage and, in such an event, in the eye of law there shall be no marriage at all between the parties at any point of time.

22. As per Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, any marriage solemnized in violation of Clause (i) (iv) and (v) of section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act is void and the same may be declared by a decree of nullity, whereas under Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act, a voidable marriage may be annulled by a decree of nullity. The different expressions used in these two provisions cannot go unnoticed. So far as Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act is concerned, the marriage is not annulled and is only declared as void by a decree of nullity. Thus, what is done by the court is only a declaration and not annulment of marriage. But, under Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act, since the marriage is not void ab initio, the same requires to be annulled by a decree of nullity. Here, it is not declaration but a positive act of annulment of the marriage by a decree of nullity. Similarly, under Section 3 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act also, the court annuls the marriage by a decree of nullity. Thus, Section 12 (1) of the Hindu Marriage Act and Section 3(1) of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act are in pari materia. Therefore, unless there is a positive decree passed by the competent court annulling the child marriage, the marriage shall be subsisting.

23. At this juncture, we may usefully refer to Mulla on principles of Hindu Law [14th Edition]. While discussing about voidable marriages he has observed as follows:-

""The scheme of the Act is to treat the marriage as valid, void and voidable. Attention has been drawn for the interlocutory note to the distinction between a marriage void ipso jure and a marriage which is voidable at the instance of one of the parties to the same. A voidable marriage remains valid and binding and continues to subsist for all purposes, unless a decree is passed by the court annulling the same on any of the grounds mentioned in the Section. The grounds it will be noticed involve the elements of incapacity of either spouse to consummate the marriage, want of mental capacity of the spouses, absence of free consent of the parties or of a guardian in marriage in case of a bride who had not completed the age of eighteen years at the time of marriage and suppressio veri by a woman, who was pregnant at the time of marriage.""

24. Hindu Law on marriages classifies the marriages into three categories namely, valid marriage, void marriage and voidable marriage. Though it is observed in Mulla that a voidable marriage remains valid and binding and continues to subsist for all purposes, unless a decree is passed by the competent court annulling the same, surely, we believe , he has not meant that a voidable marriage is a valid marriage in its stricto sensu as the expression denotes. Here, the term ""valid"" denotes the converse of the term ""invalid"". In other words, a voidable marriage is not invalid. But, at the same time, it cannot be construed stricto sensu that it is a valid marriage as per the classification referred to above. In our considered opinion , so far as the victim of the voidable marriage at whose option the marriage can be annulled is concerned, all rights emanating from a valid marriage will enure in favour of her / him. But, so far as the other spouse is concerned, the said marriage shall confer only limited rights upon him/her. But at the same time, it would impose all legal liabilities upon him/her towards the other spouse who is the victim of the voidable marriage. For example, if a minor girl is married to a boy aged more than 21 years, as per the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, undoubtedly, the marriage is a child marriage and, therefore, the same is voidable. From out of the said voidable marriage, the minor girl will acquire all the rights against the male contracting party which are otherwise available to a wife of a valid marriage. But, the male contracting party who has contracted the minor's marriage will not acquire all the rights which would otherwise emanate from a valid marriage as against the wife except certain limited rights. However, it will impose all liabilities upon the male contracting party such as liability to maintain the victim of the child marriage, liability to provide shelter and liability to afford protection , etc. For instance, if the female child contracting the marriage declines to live in the matrimonial home and prefers to live elsewhere either with parents or with somebody else , the male contracting party will not have right to obtain a decree under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act for restitution of conjugal rights. Similarly, until the female [child] attains the age of 18 years, the male cannot file a petition for divorce on any ground. If the marriage is construed to be valid stricto sensu as per the classification referred to above such rights under Sections 9 and 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act will very much be available to the male. Because the marriage remains to be voidable and the same is not valid stricto sensu, though out of the said marriage the male [major] burdens himself with liabilities towards his minor wife [child], he does not acquire all the rights against his wife like any husband of a valid marriage. This is the basic difference between a valid marriage stricto sensu and a voidable marriage. Therefore, the observation by Mulla that a voidable marriage remains valid and binding and continues to subsist shall not be understood that the marriage is a valid marriage stricto sensu as per the classification referred to above. In other words, a voidable marriage will not fall within the classification of valid marriages. The expression 'valid' used therein is a lose language and not in its strict legal sense.",cr

37 [34. Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention.âWhen a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone.]
35. When such an act is criminal by reason of its being done with a criminal knowledge or intention.âWhenever an act, which is criminal only by reason of its being done with a criminal knowlÂ­edge or intention, is done by several persons, each of such persons who joins in the act with such knowledge or intention is liable for the act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone with that knowledge or intention.
36. Effect caused partly by act and partly by omission.âWherever the causing of a certain effect, or an attempt to cause that effect, by an act or by an omission, is an offence, it is to be understood that the causing of that effect partly by an act and partly by an omission is the same offence. Illustration A intentionally causes Zâs death, partly by illegally omitting to give Z food, and partly by beating Z. A has committed murder.
37. Co-operation by doing one of several acts constituting an offence.âWhen an offence is committed by means of several acts, whoever intentionally co-operates in the commission of that offence by doing any one of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits that offence. Illustrations
(a) A and B agree to murder Z by severally and at different times giving him small doses of poison. A and B administer the poison according to the agreement with intent to murder Z. Z dies from the effects of the several doses of poison so administered to him. Here A and B intentionally co-operate in the commission of murder and as each of them does an act by which the death is caused, they are both guilty of the offence though their acts are separate.
(b) A and B are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of Z, a prisoner, alternatively for six hours at a time. A and B, intendÂ­ing to cause Zâs death, knowingly co-operate in causing that effect by illegally omitting, each during the time of his attendÂ­ance, to furnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose, Z dies of hunger. Both A and B are guilty of the murder of Z.
(c) A, a jailor, has the charge of Z, a prisoner. A, intending to cause Zâs death, illegally omits to supply Z with food; in conseÂ­quence of which Z is much reduced in strength, but the starvation is not sufficient to cause his death. A is dismissed from his office, and B succeeds him. B, without collusion or co-operation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that he is likely thereby to cause Zâs death. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of murder, but, as A did not co-operate with B. A is guilty only of an attempt to commit murder.
38. Persons concerned in criminal act may be guilty of different offences.âWhere several persons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be guilty of different offences by means of that act. Illustration A attacks Z under such circumstances of grave provocation that his killing of Z would be only culpable homicide not amounting to murder. B, having ill-will towards Z and intending to kill him, and not having been subject to the provocation, assists A in killing Z. Here, though A and B are both engaged in causing Zâs death, B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of culpable homicide.
39. âVoluntarilyâ.âA person is said to cause an effect âvolunÂ­tarilyâ when he causes it by means whereby he intended to cause it, or by means which, at the time of employing those means, he knew or had reason to believe to be likely to cause it. Illustration A sets fire, by night, to an inhabited house in a large town, for the purpose of facilitating a robbery and thus causes the death of a person. Here, A may not have intended to cause death; and may even be sorry that death has been caused by his act; yet, if he knew that he was likely to cause death, he has caused death voluntarily.

13. The plaintiff has averred that shortly after the riots in the month of November 1984, he suspended sub inspector Ramesh Rana and the defendant No. 2 pending departmental inquiry, as there were reports against them for reporting very less number of killings in the police Page No. 6/107 station Delhi Cantonment under their jurisdiction, through wireless message as compared to the actual number of killings after first day of rioting.

The plaintiff has averred that where on one hand nine police stations other than the police station Delhi Cantonment could contain the loss of life and property, the spread of virus and the blame cannot be casted upon the DCP. It is averred by the plaintiff that the source of mischief, negligence would be the local station house officer of that particular police station i.e. SHO, P.S. Delhi Cantonment, Rohtas Singh. The plaintiff has further averred that it is a mystery that how defendant No. 1 believed the version of defendant No.2 as gospel truth. The plaintiff has averred that if defendant No. 2 had made some incriminating statements against him in unguarded moments during the so-called sting, it could have some significance but it is evident from the statements made by defendant No. 2 that he was simply offering his defence by blaming others.

18. The plaintiff has averred that the sting operation is a collaborative adventure between the defendant No.1 and defendant No. 2 in which both of them stood to gain in their own way, the defendant No.1 by creating a sensational story and defendant No. 2 availing a platform to provide and offer defence.

19. The plaintiff has averred in the plaint that he had been publicly appreciated by the members of the victim community in saving lives, particularly in the area of police station Nizamuddin and the felicitation function held was attended by the plaintiff along with other local police officers after seeking due permission from the departmental authorities. It is also averred by the plaintiff that individual members of the victim Page No. 9/107 community have appreciated his services in saving lives elsewhere in the South district. It is further averred by the plaintiff that the same is a matter of record in the various inquiry reports and in case it becomes necessary, the inquiry report will be proved during the trial of the suit.

20. The plaintiff has averred in the plaint that malice and lack of good faith on the part of defendant No.1 are evident from the fact that during the sting operation, the defendant No.1 took the version of other senior officers but wilfully avoided the plaintiff to take his version of facts, as the same would have demolished the defamatory statements made by his cohort, defendant No. 2. It is averred by the plaintiff that the defendant No. 1 omitted in narration to highlight the statement of the then station house officer of Mehrauli police station, namely, Jaipal Singh, who can be clearly seen and heard stating in the impugned sting video that the plaintiff was deliberately targeted by Mr. Marwah (Marwah Inquiry Committee of November 1984) for extraneous reasons.

21. The plaintiff has averred that the timing of publishing the sting operation in print by the defendant No. 1 as well as electronic media exposes the defendant No. 1 in his purpose and intent which is not to serve any public good but to make maximum money for himself as in the print media i.e. Times of India Article dated 22.04.2014, the statements of SHO level officers are shown recorded in the year 2011 but to lend the sting currency in time, the defendant No. 1 recorded the statements of Gautam Kaul and Subhash Tandon in 2014 at the time of Page No. 10/107 voting for General Elections 2014. It is averred by the plaintiff that the same shows that the defendant No. 1 wanted to bargain form the maximum price with the political parties at the opportune time.

22. The plaintiff has averred in the plaint not only by self-serving, false statements of the defendant No. 2 but also in defendant No. 1's scurrilous anchoring, he falsely projected with malicious intention and not in good faith to make his story sensational that Nanavati Commission had recommended penal action against the plaintiff but the plaintiff escaped action because of the fact of him having retired from the police services. The plaintiff has averred that on study of the Nanavati Commission Report it is disclosed no such recommendation for penal action was made. It is further averred that in fact there was no complaint affidavit against the plaintiff filed before the Nanavati Commission. It is averred by the plaintiff that the Nanavati Commission Report has reiterated the contents of Kusum Lata Mittal Report based on which a departmental inquiry was held against the plaintiff in the year 1988 and after recording of evidence no charge was proved against the plaintiff. The government unjustifiably and in violation of the rules disagreed with the findings of the Inquiry Report of the Commissioner of Inquiries. The plaintiff has averred that he battled against the decision of the government to not accept the departmental inquiry and challenged the same before the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi and an interim order dated 23.09.1998 was passed in favour of the plaintiff.

Page No. 11/107

23. The plaintiff has averred that the matter was sub judice before the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi when he was summoned by the Nanavati Commission. The plaintiff has further averred that for the final decision the matter went up to the Central Administrative Tribunal and it was observed by the Central Administrative Tribunal that the plaintiff has been made a scapegoat and accordingly set aside the adverse order passed by the government with regard to the plaintiff's pension.

24. The plaintiff has averred that all the facts and circumstances averred by him in the plaint revealed the malicious intention, lack of good faith on the part of the defendant Nos. 1 and 2, to scandalise the plaintiff by the so-called sting operation. It is averred by the plaintiff that the defendant No. 1 resorted to such dubious tactics to make his story sensational and more saleable with no concern that it is the plaintiff's reputation which would be a collateral damage. It is averred by the plaintiff that in media one can make a false statement and get away, whereas in judicial proceedings in a court of law making a false statement may land a person in jail. It is further averred by the plaintiff that a notice dated 15.05.2014 was sent by him to the defendant No. 1 to confirm whether any reply to his notice dated 28.04.2014 had been sent by him to the plaintiff. A similar notice was also dispatched to defendant No. 2.

25. With regard to defendant No. 3, the plaintiff has averred that the defendant number three was concerned by publishing the impugned news item, which caused intense damage to the reputation of the Page No. 12/107 plaintiff and even lowered his estimation amongst retired police officers, serving police officers, relatives, friends and known social circles. It is averred by the plaintiff that the defendant No. 3 did not act in good faith and abandoned due care and caution at the peril of plaintiff's reputation. It is further averred by the plaintiff that the defendant No. 3 did not adhere to the professional standards and ethics of journalism, as he did not specify himself about the truth of the statements made against the plaintiff. It is averred by the plaintiff that journalists do not enjoy special privilege in cases of defamation and are at par with ordinary citizens. It is averred by the plaintiff in the plaint that ostensible show off in the news item cannot vouch for the interviews and the same is a subterfuge to collude with the mala fide, evil designs of defendant Nos. 1 and 2.

26. The plaintiff has averred in the plaint that the defendants acted wrongfully, maliciously and dishonestly with reckless disregard for truth and resultant of which the defendants are joint tortfeasors and are jointly and severally liable for damages be it general, special, exemplary and punitive for causing pecuniary and nonpecuniary losses to the plaintiff. It is averred by the plaintiff that he has suffered huge and substantial damage, as he is widely known in the areas of his postings among the retired and serving officers and as a minimalistic estimate, the plaintiff claims â¹15,00,000/- (Rupees Fifteen lakhs only) as damages from the defendants.

27. The plaintiff has averred that the cause of action arose to prefer and maintain the present suit against the defendants arose on 22.04.2014, Page No. 13/107 when the impugned news article/report was published in the newspaper and thereafter subsequent cause of action arose on the dates when the plaintiff issued notice to the defendants. It is averred by the plaintiff that the cause of action arose in Dwarka, New Delhi where the newspaper in question is widely circulated and read. It is also averred by the plaintiff that the cause of action arose in New Delhi as serious injury and damage has been caused to his reputation. Hence, the suit for damages to the tune of â¹15,00,000/- (Rupees Fifteen lakhs only) on account of the plaintiff being defamed by the defendants.

28. The written statement preferred by Aniruddha Bahal (defendant No. 1) has taken the preliminary objection of the suit being barred for misjoinder of parties. The defendant No. 1 has also taken a preliminary objection of no cause of action having arisen in favour of the plaintiff to prefer a suit for damages against the defendant No. 1. The defendant No. 1 has also taken a preliminary objection that the plaint is bereft of any single averment with regard to in whose eyes and for whom the plaintiff has been defamed. The defendant No. 1 has taken a preliminary objection that the plaint preferred by the plaintiff is nothing but false and concocted facts to mislead the Court and to harass the defendant No. 1. The defendant No. 1 has also taken a preliminary objection on the maintainability of the suit for want of jurisdiction.

29. From the perusal of the reply on merits in the written statement, the defence urged by the defendant No. 1 is that of a shield of the justification of truth. It is urged by the defendant No. 1 that the news Page No. 14/107 article was based on information already available in the public domain and which also formed part of Mishra Commission, Kusum Lata Lata Mittal Report, Nanawati Commission Report.

30. The defendant No. 1 in its written statement has declined that he had colluded with the other defendants, particularly, defendant No. 2 and caused any loss and damage to the reputation of the plaintiff. The defendant No. 1 has declined all the allegations made by the plaintiff in his plaint that the sting operation was undertaken by the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 to make maximum money in the year of General Elections. The defendant No. 1 has averred in his defence that Cobrapost is a purely journalistic venture of forum for media and literature, a non-profit non- government organisation advocating free media by generating critical discussion on key social issues. It is also averred by defendant No. 1 in his defence that he absolutely has no commercial interest. In short, the defendant No. 1, has urged in his defence that he never sullied the reputation of the plaintiff and with the plaintiff not being defamed, no case for awarding damages is made out.

31. The written statement preferred by the defendant No. 2 is also on the similar lines of the defendant No. 1 that no disrepute has been caused to the plaintiff. It is urged by the defendant No. 2 that the plaintiff had unfairly and in a biased manner impleaded him on false grounds in an arbitrary and illegal manner in the year 1984. It is averred by the defendant No. 2 in his statement that the plaintiff is nursing an Page No. 15/107 old grudge against the defendant No. 2, which is apparent nay evident from the plaint.

32. The defendant No. 2 has also urged that the suit is not maintainable against him for want of cause of action. It is urged by the defendant No. 2 that he was neither involved in the alleged sting operation carried out by Cobrapost nor in the impugned news article published in the Times of India on 22.0.2014.

33. The defendant No. 2 has denied seeing the original compact disc (CD) of the alleged sting operation but he has averred in his defence that to his knowledge he never gave any interview and spoke to any personal of the Cobrapost alleging imputations against the plaintiff.

34. The defendant No. 2 has admitted in his defence that he was the station house officer of the police station Delhi Cantonment in the year 1984 and the plaintiff was the Deputy Commissioner of Police of South district. The defendant No. 2 has denied any dereliction of duty on his part. It is averred by the defendant No. 2 that the plaintiff was biased towards him on account of the defendant No. 2 being an upright officer for which the plaintiff suspended him temporarily. It is averred by the defendant No. 2 that the plaintiff did not disclose in his plaint that the defendant No. 2 was reinstated with all the benefits and even promoted to the rank of Asstt. Commissioner of Police. The defendant No. 2 has averred in the written statement that the plaintiff has concealed the fact from this Court that the defendant No. 2 was given a clean chit by the Ranganath Misra Commissioner. It is further averred by the defendant Page No. 16/107 No. 2 that the plaintiff had been hellbent to ruin his reputation. In short, the defendant No. 2 has denied having defamed the plaintiff in any manner. The defendant No. 2 has urged that the suit preferred by the plaintiff against him be dismissed as no case of defamation is made out.

35. The written statement preferred on behalf of the defendant No. 3 assails the maintainability of the suit for being a total abuse of process of law.

36. The defendant No. 3 has stated in his defence that the news article published relied upon a sting and the defendant repeatedly emphasised the fact that the sting revealed are only allegations and defendant did not in any way endorse them. It is urged by the defendant No. 3 that he was careful in ensuring that nowhere did it appear that it was either vouching for the authenticity of the sting and the allegations made by those stung, even if the tapes were authentic. The defendant No. 3 has averred in his written statement that he was careful to an extent that he even made it clear in the article that Rohtas Singh (defendant No. 2 herein), the man making the allegations against the plaintiff was himself indicted by an inquiry commission.

37. The defendant No. 3 has urged in his defence that the news article/report was published based on the premise, for the information of his readers in public interest without any illegal or malice against the plaintiff. It is averred by the defendant No. 3 that it is within common knowledge that innocent people of particular community lost their lives and with passage of time there are people, who are still fighting in Page No. 17/107 Courts to get justice. It is urged by the defendant No. 3 that the sting was on matter of public interest and the same was published for the information of the readers as the readers have a right to know, which is a part of freedom of speech of expression indeed a valuable right granted by the Constitution of the country. The defendant No. 3 has averred that the article was published only with the intention to inform its readers about the sting and what has come out in the sting without giving his views or vouching for the authenticity of the sting of statements of the stung.

38. The defendant No. 3 has denied all the allegations made by the plaintiff and taken a stance that no case for defamation is made out in favour of the plaintiff and the question of awarding damages to the tune of â¹15,00,000/- (Rupees Fifteen lakhs only) does not arise.

39. To the written statements filed by the defendants, the plaintiff did file respective replications.

Uday Umesh Lalit, J.

1. Leave granted.

2. These appeals arise out of the common judgment and order dated 12.02.2019 passed by the High Court1 in Criminal Revision No.2996 of 2015 and Criminal Revision No. 2556 of 2016.

3. One G. S. Naidu, who owned a Maruti-800 vehicle of 1995 make, Signature Not Verified Digitally signed by MUKESH KUMAR Date: 2020.03.02 passed away on 12.12.2001 leaving behind his widow, three sons and a 18:16:19 IST Reason:

High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Principal Bench, Jabalpur Criminal Appeal Nos.367-368 of 2020 @ SLP(Crl.)Nos.4418-4419 of 2020 Samta Naidu & Anr. Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and Anr.
daughter (who was unmarried and has since then passed away). His second son (Complainant in the present matter) filed a complaint against his brother (the third son of G. S. Naidu) and his wife, submitting as under:-

â3. It is submitted that the father of the complainant namely Late G.S. Naidu passed away on 12.12.2001. A copy of the death certificate in this regard is enclosed herewith as Annexure A/1 with this complaint.
4. It is submitted that on 2.11.2010, the aforesaid vehicle has been sold by the respondent by putting forged signatures of the complainantâs father on the Form 29 and 30 and also put forged signature on the affidavit annexed with Form No.29 and 30 knowing fully well that Late G.S. Naidu has passed away on 12.12.2001. A true copy of Form No.29 and 30 and the affidavit is being filed herewith as Annexure A/2. It is submitted that on the date when the vehicle was sold which was being owned by G.S. Naidu, the father of the complainant was no more.
5. It is submitted that respondent Nos. 1 and 2, in order to sell the vehicle, has forged the signature of Late G.S. Naidu knowing fully well that he has passed away. It is also submitted that the documents which have been forged by the respondents have been subsequently used for getting the benefit in the form of sale consideration of the vehicle. The act of the respondents squarely covers the offences punishable under Sections 409, 420, 467, 468 and 471 of the IPC and therefore, the respondents are liable to be punished accordingly. Hence, the present complaint is being filed before this Honâble Court.â Criminal Appeal Nos.367-368 of 2020 @ SLP(Crl.)Nos.4418-4419 of 2020 Samta Naidu & Anr. Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and Anr.
4. The Complaint came up before the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Jabalpur, who, by his order dated 05.07.2013 concluded as under:-

âOn the basis of evidence and document produced on behalf of complainant it appears that no prima facie case is made out against accused Samta Naidu and Dilip Naidu.
Hence complaint under Section 203 Criminal Procedure Code is rejected and thereby dismissed.â
5. The complainant being aggrieved, filed Revision before the VIII Additional Sessions Judge, Jabalpur. On 05.03.2014 the Counsel for the Complainant submitted that he wished to withdraw the Revision with liberty to file a fresh complaint on the basis of certain new facts, which request was opposed. After perusing the record and considering the submissions, the Revisional Court observed as under:-

âThis is well settled position that new complaint can be filed any time on the basis of new facts and for which purposes there is no need of permission of this Court or permission of any court. Because revisionist does not wish to press instant revision any more, hence instant revision is dismissed on this ground alone. Revision Petition is thus disposed of accordingly.â
6. Thereafter, Complaint Case No. 9226 of 2014 was preferred by the Complainant on same allegations but relying on additional material adverted to in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of said Complaint, the material was:- Criminal Appeal Nos.367-368 of 2020 @ SLP(Crl.)Nos.4418-4419 of 2020 Samta Naidu & Anr. Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and Anr.
a) The credit note in the sum of Rs.37,500/- issued upon request of the Appellants by the representatives of Standard Auto Agency, Jabalpur after valuing the vehicle.

b) The fact that said amount of Rs.37,500/- was thereafter adjusted towards purchase of a new vehicle in the name of the first Appellant.

c) The Registration Certificate of the new vehicle issued in the name of first Appellant.

d) Certified copies of said documents received from the office of RTO, Jabalpur.

Based on the aforesaid documents, it was submitted that cognizance be taken of the offences punishable under Sections 201, 409, 420, 467, 468 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short, âIPCâ).

7. On 02.08.2014, the Judicial Magistrate First Class Jabalpur took cognizance in respect of offence punishable under Section 420 IPC but rejected the Complaint with respect to other offences, which order was challenged by the Complainant by preferring Criminal Revision No.288 of 2014. Said Revision was allowed by the 9th Additional Sessions Judge, Jabalpur, by his order dated 02.11.2015 directing the Magistrate to reconsider the documents available on record and to pass appropriate Criminal Appeal Nos.367-368 of 2020 @ SLP(Crl.)Nos.4418-4419 of 2020 Samta Naidu & Anr. Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and Anr.
order for taking cognizance in regard to appropriate offences. This order was challenged by the Appellants by filing Criminal Revision No.2996 of 2015 in the High Court.

8. During the pendency of the aforesaid Revision in the High Court, the matter was taken up and the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Jabalpur took cognizance of all offences alleged in the complaint. Thereafter, the Additional Sessions Judge â X by his order dated 20.09.2016 framed charges against the Appellants in respect of offences punishable under Sections 120-B, 420, 467, 468 and 471 of the IPC. This order led to the filing of Criminal Revision No.2556 of 2016 by the Appellants in the High Court. Both the aforesaid Criminal Revisions were heard together by the High Court.

9. On the question, whether the second complaint was maintainable or not, the High Court relied upon the decision of this Court in Pramatha Nath Taluqdar vs. Saroj Ranjan Sarkar2 and observed:-

â12. However, in the context of the instant case, when we compare the two complaints, it is obvious that at the time of filing the first complaint, the complainant seems to be aware only of the fact that accused persons Dilip and Samta had unilaterally sold a car belonging to G. Shankar Naidu and which, after his death, had become joint family property. The complainant seems to have acquired AIR 1962 SC 876 = (1962) Supp 2 SCR 297 Criminal Appeal Nos.367-368 of 2020 @ SLP(Crl.)Nos.4418-4419 of 2020 Samta Naidu & Anr. Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and Anr.
the knowledge of details of the transaction later.
Therefore, subsequent complaint provides the particulars of the transaction in far greater details.â The High Court, thus, found no infirmity warranting interference and dismissed both the Revision Petitions.

10. While issuing notice in the present matters this Court directed the Appellants to deposit a sum of Rs.45,000/- (Rupees Forty Five Thousand Only) in the Registry of this Court within two weeks. Said sum stands deposited in the Registry. This direction was passed so that if any of the heirs of G. S. Naidu felt that his share in the property left behind by the deceased was not being given to him, the internal disputes/difference between the members of the family could be sorted out. But such suggestions were not acceptable to the Complainant.

11. The parties thereafter exchanged pleadings and the matter was heard. Mr. Devadatt Kamat, learned Senior Advocate, appeared in support of the Appeal. Relying on the decision of this Court in Taluqdar2, he submitted that the High Court was in error in rejecting the Revision Applications. Ms. Meenakshi Arora, learned Senior Advocate for the respondent-complainant also relied upon the same decision and other decisions referred to by the High Court, to submit that as new material Criminal Appeal Nos.367-368 of 2020 @ SLP(Crl.)Nos.4418-4419 of 2020 Samta Naidu & Anr. Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and Anr.
was found, the second Complaint was rightly considered and taken cognizance of.

12. The principal decision relied upon by both sides is one rendered by a Bench of three Judges of this Court in Taluqdar2. Para 35 of the majority decision authored by Kapur, J. discloses that a Complaint under Sections 467 and 471 read with Section 109 of the IPC was preferred on the allegations that an unregistered deed of agreement purportedly executed on 19.01.1948, a transfer deed in respect of 1000 shares purportedly executed on 05.02.1951 and the minutes of proceedings of the Board meetings purporting to bear the signature of late Sri Nalini Ranjan Sarkar were stated to have been forged. The Chief Presidency Magistrate dismissed the complaint against which Revision was preferred before the High Court of Calcutta. Said Revision Petition was dismissed and the matter was carried before this Court but the Appeal was dismissed as withdrawn. Thereafter, another complaint was brought under very same Sections. The Chief Presidency Magistrate took cognizance of second Complaint against which order, Revision was preferred in the High Court of Calcutta. The matter came up before the Division Bench and the additional material projected in support of the submission that the second Criminal Appeal Nos.367-368 of 2020 @ SLP(Crl.)Nos.4418-4419 of 2020 Samta Naidu & Anr. Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and Anr.
Complaint was maintainable was dealt with by the Division Bench. The matter in that behalf was adverted to this Court as under:-

âIn regard to the filing of a second complaint it held that a fresh complaint could be entertained after the dismissal of previous complaint under Section 203 Criminal Procedure Code when there was manifest error or manifest miscarriage of justice or when fresh evidence was forthcoming. The Bench was of the opinion that the fact in regard to the City Telephone Exchange was a new matter and because Pramode Ranjan Sarkar was not permitted to take a photostat copy of the minutes-book, it was possible that his attention was not drawn to the City Telephone Exchange which was not in existence at the relevant time and that there was sufficient reason for Pramode Ranjan Sarkar for not mentioning the matter of City Exchange in his complaint. It also held that the previous Chief Presidency Magistrate Mr Chakraborty had altogether ignored the evidence of a large number of witnesses who were competent to prove the handwriting and signature of N.R. Sarkar and he had no good reasons for not accepting their evidence. It could not be said therefore that there was a judicial enquiry of the matter before the previous Chief Presidency Magistrate; the decision was rather arbitrary and so resulted in manifest miscarriage of justice. The Court was of the opinion therefore that there was no reason to differ from the finding of the Chief Presidency Magistrate Mr Bijoyesh Mukerjee and that there was a prima facie case against the appellants.â 12.1 The issue was considered by the majority judgment of this Court as under:-
â48. Under the Code of Criminal Procedure the subject of âComplaints to Magistratesâ is dealt with in Chapter 16 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The provisions relevant for the purpose of this case are Sections 200, 202 and 203. Section 200 deals Criminal Appeal Nos.367-368 of 2020 @ SLP(Crl.)Nos.4418-4419 of 2020 Samta Naidu & Anr. Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and Anr.
with examination of complainants and Sections 202, 203 and 204 with the powers of the Magistrate in regard to the dismissal of complaint or the issuing of process. The scope and extent of Sections 202 and 203 were laid down in Vadilal Panchal v. Dattatraya Dulaji Ghadigaonker3. The scope of enquiry under Section 202 is limited to finding out the truth or otherwise of the complaint in order to determine whether process should issue or not and Section 203 lays down what materials are to be considered for the purpose. Under Section 203 Criminal Procedure Code the judgment which the Magistrate has to form must be based on the statements of the complainant and of his witnesses and the result of the investigation or enquiry if any. He must apply his mind to the materials and form his judgment whether or not there is sufficient ground for proceeding. Therefore if he has not misdirected himself as to the scope of the enquiry made under Section 202, of the Criminal Procedure Code, and has judicially applied his mind to the material before him and then proceeds to make his order it cannot be said that he has acted erroneously. An order of dismissal under Section 203, of the Criminal Procedure Code, is, however, no bar to the entertainment of a second complaint on the same facts but it will be entertained only in exceptional circumstances, e.g., where the previous order was passed on an incomplete record or on a misunderstanding of the nature of the complaint or it was manifestly absurd, unjust or foolish or where new facts which could not, with reasonable diligence, have been brought on the record in the previous proceedings, have been adduced. It cannot be said to be in the interests of justice that after a decision has been given against the complainant upon a full consideration of his case, he or any other person should be given another opportunity to have his complaint enquired into.

Payagude6 Doraisami v. Subramania7. In regard to the adducing of new facts for the bringing of a fresh complaint the Special Bench in the judgment under appeal did not accept the view of the Bombay High Court or the Patna High Court in the cases above quoted and adopted the opinion of Maclean, C.J. in Queen Empress v. Dolegobinda Das8 affirmed by a Full Bench in Dwarka Nath Mandal v. Benimadhas Banerji9. It held therefore that a fresh complaint can be entertained where there is manifest error, or manifest miscarriage of justice in the previous order or when fresh evidence is forthcoming.â 12.2 It was observed in para 50 as under:-

â50. Taking first the question of fresh evidence, the view of some of the High Courts that it should be such that it could not with reasonable diligence have been adduced is, in our opinion, a correct view of the law. It cannot be the law that the complainant may first place before the Magistrate some of the facts and evidence in his possession and if he fails he can then adduce some more evidence and so on.
That in our opinion, is not a correct view of the law.â 12.3 The majority judgment thus accepted the challenge, allowed the Appeal and dismissed the Complaint with following observations:-

â61. In these circumstances, we are of the opinion that the bringing of the fresh complaint is a gross abuse of the process of the Court and is not with the object of furthering the interests of justice.

63. For these reasons we allow the appeals, set aside the order of the High Court and of the learned Chief Presidency Magistrate and dismiss the complaint.â 12.4 The dissenting opinion was expressed by S.K. Das, J.

13. The law declared in Taluqdar2 has consistently been followed, for instance, in Bindeshwari Prasad Singh vs. Kali Singh10 it was observed: âIt is now well settled that a second complaint can lie only on fresh facts or even on the previous facts only if a special case is made outâ. The view taken in Bindeshwari10 was followed in Maj. Genl. A.S. Gauraya and another vs. S.N. Thakur and another11.

13.1 In Jatinder Singh and Others vs. Ranjit Kaur12 the issue was whether the first complaint having been dismissed for default, could the second complaint be maintained. The matter was considered as under:-

â9. There is no provision in the Code or in any other statute which debars a complainant from preferring a second complaint on the same allegations if the first complaint did not result in a conviction or acquittal or even discharge. Section 300 of the Code, which debars a second trial, has taken care to explain that âthe dismissal of a complaint, or the discharge of the accused, is not an acquittal for the purposes of this sectionâ. However, when a Magistrate conducts an (1997) 1 SCC 57 (1986) 2 SCC 709 (2001) 2 SCC 570 Criminal Appeal Nos.367-368 of 2020 @ SLP(Crl.)Nos.4418-4419 of 2020 Samta Naidu & Anr. Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and Anr.
inquiry under Section 202 of the Code and dismisses the complaint on merits, a second complaint on the same facts cannot be made unless there are very exceptional circumstances. Even so, a second complaint is permissible depending upon how the complaint happened to be dismissed at the first instance.
â¦ â¦ â¦
12. If the dismissal of the complaint was not on merit but on default of the complainant to be present there is no bar in the complainant moving the Magistrate again with a second complaint on the same facts. But if the dismissal of the complaint under Section 203 of the Code was on merits the position could be different. There appeared a difference of opinion earlier as to whether a second complaint could have been filed when the dismissal was under Section 203. The controversy was settled by this Court in Pramatha Nath Talukdar v. Saroj Ranjan Sarkar2. A majority of Judges of the three-Judge Bench held thus:
âAn order of dismissal under Section 203, Criminal Procedure Code, is, however, no bar to the entertainment of a second complaint on the same facts but it will be entertained only in exceptional circumstances, e.g., where the previous order as passed on an incomplete record or on a misunderstanding of the nature of the complaint or it was manifestly absurd, unjust or foolish or where new facts which could not, with reasonable diligence, have been brought on the record in the previous proceedings, have been adduced. It cannot be said to be in the interest of justice that after a decision has been given against the complaint upon a full consideration of his case, he or any other person should be given another opportunity to have his complaint inquired into.â S.K. Das, J. (as he then was) while dissenting from the said majority view had taken the stand that right of a complainant to file a second complaint would not be Criminal Appeal Nos.367-368 of 2020 @ SLP(Crl.)Nos.4418-4419 of 2020 Samta Naidu & Anr. Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and Anr.
inhibited even by such considerations. But at any rate the majority view is that the second complaint would be maintainable if the dismissal of the first complaint was not on merits.â (Emphasis supplied) 13.2. In Ranvir Singh vs. State of Haryana and Another13 the issue was set out in para 23 of the decision and the discussion that followed thereafter was as under:-
â23. In the instant case, the question is narrowed down further as to whether such a second complaint would be maintainable when the earlier one had not been dismissed on merits, but for the failure of the complainant to put in the process fees for effecting service.
24. The answer has been provided firstly in Pramatha Nath Talukdar case2, wherein this Court had held that even if a complaint was dismissed under Section 203 CrPC, a second complaint would still lie under exceptional circumstances, indicated hereinbefore. The said view has been consistently upheld in subsequent decisions of this Court. Of course, the question of making a prayer for recalling the order of dismissal would not be maintainable before the learned Magistrate in view of Section 362 CrPC, but such is not the case in these special leave petitions.
25. In the present cases, neither have the complaints been dismissed on merit nor have they been dismissed at the stage of Section 203 CrPC. On the other hand, only on being satisfied of a prima facie case, the learned Magistrate had issued process on the complaint.
26. The said situation is mainly covered by the decision of this Court in Jatinder Singh case12, wherein the (2009) 9 SCC 642 Criminal Appeal Nos.367-368 of 2020 @ SLP(Crl.)Nos.4418-4419 of 2020 Samta Naidu & Anr. Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and Anr.
decision in Pramatha Nath Talukdar case2 was also taken into consideration and it was categorically observed that in the absence of any provision in the Code barring a second complaint being filed on the same allegation, there would be no bar to a second complaint being filed on the same facts if the first complaint did not result in the conviction or acquittal or even discharge of the accused, and if the dismissal was not on merit but on account of a default on the part of the complainant.â 13.3. In Poonam Chand Jain and Another vs. Fazru14 the issue whether after the dismissal of the earlier complaint had attained finality, could a second complaint be maintained on identical facts was considered as under:-

â14. In the background of these facts, the question which crops up for determination by this Court is whether after an order of dismissal of complaint attained finality, the complainant can file another complaint on almost identical facts without disclosing in the second complaint the fact of either filing of the first complaint or its dismissal.
15. Almost similar questions came up for consideration before this Court in Pramatha Nath Talukdar v. Saroj Ranjan Sarkar2. The majority judgment in Pramatha Nath2 was delivered by Kapur, J. His Lordship held that an order of dismissal under Section 203 of the Criminal Procedure Code (for short âthe Codeâ) is, however, no bar to the entertainment of a second complaint on the same facts but it can be entertained only in exceptional circumstances. This Court explained the exceptional circumstances as:
(a) where the previous order was passed on incomplete record, or (2010) 2 SCC 631 Criminal Appeal Nos.367-368 of 2020 @ SLP(Crl.)Nos.4418-4419 of 2020 Samta Naidu & Anr. Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and Anr.
(b) on a misunderstanding of the nature of the complaint, or
(c) the order which was passed was manifestly absurd, unjust or foolish, or
(d) where new facts which could not, with reasonable diligence, have been brought on the record in the previous proceedings.
16. This Court in Pramatha Nath2 made it very clear that interest of justice cannot permit that after a decision has been given on a complaint upon full consideration of the case, the complainant should be given another opportunity to have the complaint enquired into again. In para 50 of the judgment the majority judgment of this Court opined that fresh evidence or fresh facts must be such which could not with reasonable diligence have been brought on record. This Court very clearly held that it cannot be settled law which permits the complainant to place some evidence before the Magistrate which are in his possession and then if the complaint is dismissed adduce some more evidence. According to this Court, such a course is not permitted on a correct view of the law. (para 50, p. 899)",cr
"Madan B. Lokur, J.

1. The question for consideration is whether the appellant Bhola Ram was rightly convicted by both the Trial Court and the High Court for having caused the dowry death of Janki Devi, an offence punishable under Section 304-B and Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). In our opinion, Bhola Ram deserves an acquittal since there is no evidence inculpating him.

The facts:

2. Darshan Ram married Janki Devi on 30th June, 1986 after which they resided in Darshan Ramâs house in village Mehma Sarja. The couple has a female child.

3. At the time of their marriage, Janki Deviâs family gave dowry within their means to Darshan Ram and his family. But according to the prosecution, his brothers Parshottam Ram and Bhola Ram (the appellant) and his sister Krishna Devi and mother Vidya Devi demanded more dowry from time to time.

4. Janki Deviâs family was unable to fulfill the additional demands for dowry and, according to the prosecution, she was humiliated and cruelly treated by Darshan Ramâs family for their incapacity. Being unable to face the harassment, cruelty and humiliation meted out by Darshan Ramâs family, Janki Devi consumed poison and thereby committed suicide on 6th September, 1989.

5. About one and a half months before her death, a demand for Rs. 10,000/- was made by Janki Deviâs in-laws for the purchase of a car. Janki Deviâs father PW-2 Nath Ram borrowed this amount from PW-1 Nirbhai Singh for meeting the dowry demand. The amount was then handed over by him to Darshan Ram in the presence of other members of his family.

6. Unfortunately, Darshan Ramâs family was not fully satisfied with this payment. According to the prosecution, about a fortnight before her death, Janki Devi came to her father and told him that there was a further demand for an amount of Rs. 30,000/- for purchasing some articles for a service station proposed to be run by Darshan Ram and Bhola Ram. Thereupon, Nath Ram accompanied Janki Devi to her matrimonial home and informed Darshan Ram and the other accused that he would not be able to pay this amount. On this, Darshan Ramâs family informed him that he should pay the amount failing which he could take Janki Devi back with him. Nath Ram requested the family not to insist on the demand and left Janki Devi at her matrimonial home in village Mehma Sarja.

7. On 3rd September, 1989 PW-3 Des Raj, the brother of Nath Ramâs wife, informed Nath Ram about Janki Devi being ill-treated on account of Nath Ramâs inability to meet the additional demand for dowry. Again on 5th September, 1989 Des Raj informed Nath Ram that Janki Devi wanted to meet Nath Ram and was weeping in his presence.

8. On receiving this information, Nath Ram went to village Mehma Sarja along with his brother PW-4 Sukhdev Ram. When they reached the bus stand in the village they were informed that Janki Devi had consumed poison and had taken her life, having suffered more than enough cruelty at the hands of the family of Darshan Ram. Nath Ram and Sukhdev Ram then proceeded to Janki Deviâs matrimonial home and found her lying there but no one from Darshan Ramâs family was present in the matrimonial home.

9. Nath Ram then lodged a First Information Report (FIR) in Police Station Nehianwala. On the basis of the FIR PW-7 Manminder Singh prepared an inquest report in the presence of Sukhdev Ram. On the next day, that is 7th September, 1989 PW-5 Dr. Tirath Goyal performed an autopsy on the dead body of Janki Devi. He noted that froth was coming out from her nose and mouth. Her viscera were sent to the Chemical Examiner who reported that Janki Devi had died due to having consumed an organo phosphorus insecticide which was poisonous and sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature.

10. On the basis of the above details and further investigations, a charge sheet was filed against Darshan Ram and four members of his family (including Bhola Ram) under Section 304-B and Section 498-A of the IPC for causing the dowry death of Janki Devi.

11. The accused pleaded not guilty and were tried by the Sessions Judge at Bathinda.

Decision of the Trial Judge

12. In his Judgment and Order dated 3rd December, 1991 the Sessions Judge at Bathinda in Sessions Case No. 35 of 15th May, 1990 held that Section 304- B of the IPC required the prosecution to establish four ingredients, namely: (i) the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances, (ii) such death should have occurred within seven years of her marriage, (iii) soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband, and (iv) such cruelty or harassment should be for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry. In the present case, all four ingredients were established by the prosecution.

13. It was further held that Darshan Ram, Bhola Ram and their mother Vidya Devi were living together in the same house at village Mehma Sarja and that they had demanded additional dowry from Janki Deviâs family. However, Parshottam Ram and Krishna Devi were living separately and they could not be said to have caused the dowry death of Janki Devi. Consequently, Parshottam Ram and Krishna Devi were found not guilty of the charges framed against them and they were acquitted. However, the Sessions Judge found that Darshan Ram, Bhola Ram and Vidya Devi, by their attitude and behaviour, caused Janki Devi to take the extreme step of taking her own life. These three accused were accordingly convicted for offences punishable under Section 304-B and Section 498-A of the IPC and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 7 years with fine for the offence under Section 304-B of the IPC and 2 years rigorous imprisonment for the offence under Section 498-A of the IPC.

14. The accused preferred two appeals (one by Vidya Devi and the other by Darshan Ram and Bhola Ram) against their conviction and sentence in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana.

Decision of the High Court

15. In so far as Vidya Devi is concerned, her conviction was upheld by the High Court and she preferred a Special Leave Petition in this Court. She was granted special leave to appeal but during the pendency of her appeal she passed away and accordingly her appeal was disposed of.

16. Darshan Ram and Bhola Ram preferred a joint appeal in the High Court being Criminal Appeal No. 25 SB of 1992. This appeal was heard by a learned Single Judge who by his Judgment and Order dated 5th July, 2004 upheld their conviction and sentence.

17. The High Court held that Vidya Devi, Darshan Ram and Bhola Ram were all residing together in the same house at village Mehma Sarja. It was held that the amount of Rs. 10,000/- initially taken from Nath Ram was used to purchase a car for Darshan Ram and that car was being plied as a taxi by him. It was also held that a service station was at the initial stages of being established by Darshan Ram and Bhola Ram and that they needed Rs. 30,000/- for expenses in connection with that venture. Since all three convicts were residing together at village Mehma Sarja, they were equally responsible for demanding additional dowry from Janki Devi and her father and thereby compelling her to take her life.

18. It appears that Darshan Ram has not challenged the Judgment and Order of the learned Single Judge and his conviction and sentence have attained finality.

19. We are, therefore, only concerned with the appeal filed by Bhola Ram who challenged his conviction and sentence in this Court and was granted special leave to appeal on 8th July, 2008. He was also granted bail by this Court on the same day and we are told that even today, he is on bail. Discussion

20. Learned counsel for Bhola Ram submitted that in fact there is no specific allegation against him. The statements of all the witnesses are omnibus or generic in nature and Darshan Ram and other members of his family have been generally accused of having demanded additional dowry from Janki Deviâs family. It is submitted that in the absence of any particular allegation, demands for dowry made by Darshan Ram cannot be attributed to Bhola Ram and under these circumstances, there is really no evidence to uphold his conviction.

21. On the other hand, it was submitted by learned counsel for the State that the three convicts were jointly and directly concerned with the demands of additional dowry made on Janki Devi and her family. Consequently, it is not possible to segregate the case of Bhola Ram from that of the other two convicts.

22. We are unable to accept the contention of learned counsel for the State. The Sessions Judge found that there was no evidence that Parshottam Ram and Krishna Devi made demands for additional dowry from Nath Ram. Accordingly, they were acquitted at the trial stage itself. Therefore, the segregation process, based on the evidence on record, had begun at the trial stage. This is clearly because in a dowry death, some actors play an active role while others play a passive role. Consequntly, to sustain the conviction of Bhola Ram, there must be some suggestive evidence and not generic evidence implicating him in the demand for additional dowry from Nath Ram.

23. As observed by the Law Commission of India (LCI) in its 91st Report of 10th August, 1983 (in paragraph 1.8) the truth may not come in a dowry death case due to the sequestered nature of the offence. This is what the LCI said:

âThose who have studied crime and its incidence know that once a serious crime is committed, detection is a difficult matter and still more difficult is successful prosecution of the offender. Crimes that lead to dowry deaths are almost invariably committed within the safe precincts of a residential house. The criminal is a member of the family; other members of the family (if residing in the same house) are either guilty associates in crime, or silent but conniving witnesses to it. In any case, the shackles of the family are so strong that truth may not come out of the chains. There would be no other eye witnesses, except for members of the family.â
24. This passage also clearly brings out that in a case of a dowry death, every member of the family may not be fully and equally guilty. The degree of involvement may differ â as an associate, as a silent witness, as a conniving witness and so on.

25. So far as this case is concerned, we have gone through the evidence of all the witnesses on record and while there is no doubt that Janki Devi died an unnatural death within a few years of her marriage to Darshan Ram, no definite allegation has been made by any of the witnesses including Nath Ram or anybody from his family that Bhola Ram had demanded any additional dowry from him or anybody in his family or had treated Janki Devi with cruelty or in a humiliating manner so as to make him complicit in the dowry death.

26. In Kans Raj v. State of Punjab, (2000) 5 SCC 2007 the ingredients of an offence under Section 304-B of the IPC were held to be as follows:

âIn order to seek a conviction against a person for the offence of dowry death, the prosecution is obliged to prove that:
(a) the death of a woman was caused by burns or bodily injury or had occurred otherwise than under normal circumstances;
(b) such death should have occurred within 7 years of her marriage;
(c) the deceased was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or by any relative of her husband;
(d) such cruelty or harassment should be for or in connection with the demand of dowry; and
(e) to such cruelty or harassment the deceased should have been subjected soon before her death.â
27. It is true that there was a demand of dowry of Rs. 10,000/- which was paid by Nath Ram by borrowing this amount from Nirbhai Singh, but that demand was for the purchase of a car for use by Darshan Ram. Under the circumstances, it can safely be presumed that Darshan Ram made the demand for additional dowry for his benefit. Bhola Ram may have been a silent or a passively conniving participant, but there is nothing on record to suggest that he had either actively made such a demand or that the demanded amount was sought to be utilized for his benefit either directly or indirectly.
28. Similarly, the evidence on record does not show that the demand of another amount of Rs.30,000/- from Nath Ram just a fortnight before Janki Devi took her life was made by Bhola Ram to purchase articles for the service station being set up by him and Darshan Ram at village Nehianwala. At best, it could be said that this amount was intended for use for the joint business venture of Bhola Ram and Darshan Ram. Given that the earlier demand for additional dowry was made for the benefit of Darshan Ram, it is more than likely that this demand was also made by him. In any event, there is again nothing to suggest that Bhola Ram was in any manner actively concerned in making the demand directly or indirectly from Nath Ram.

29. Consequently, we do not find any evidence to suggest any active complicity of Bhola Ram in demanding any additional dowry from Nath Ram either for himself or for Darshan Ram or his proposed business venture.

30. Merely making a demand for dowry is not enough to bring about a conviction under Section 304-B of the IPC. As held in Kans Raj a dowry death victim should also have been treated with cruelty or harassed for dowry either by her husband or a relative. In this case, even assuming the silent or conniving participation of Bhola Ram in the demands for dowry, there is absolutely no evidence on record to suggest that he actively or passively treated Janki Devi with cruelty or harassed her in connection with, or for, dowry. The High Court has, unfortunately, not adverted to this ingredient of an offence punishable under Section 304-B of the IPC or even considered it.

31. The High Court has relied on the presumption available under Section 113-B of the Evidence Act, 1872 to conclude that Janki Deviâs death was a dowry death. However, this presumption cannot be stretched to implicate all and sundry in Darshan Ramâs family in demanding additional dowry from Janki Deviâs family and harassing her and treating her with such cruelty that she had to resort to taking her life. As mentioned above, there is a possibility of members of the family having varying roles, active and passive. Depending on the nature and extent of involvement, a person may be punished for an offence under Section 498-A or Section 304-B or Section 306 of the IPC or Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. A dowry death will not ipso facto suck the husband with all his relatives into the net of Section 304-B of the IPC.

32. It was contended by learned counsel for the State that Darshan Ram, Bhola Ram and Vidya Devi were living together at village Mehma Sarja and so their active involvement in the dowry death cannot be ruled out. While these persons may be staying together, it does not lead to any positive conclusion that each one of them was actively involved in demanding additional dowry from Janki Devi and also behaving in a cruel or humiliating manner towards her resulting in her consuming poison to end her life. In cases of this nature which attract a reverse onus of proof, the least that is expected of the prosecution to bring home a charge under Section 304-B of the IPC is to adduce some evidence to suggestively implicate a relative, in this case, to suggestively implicate Bhola Ram both in the demands for additional dowry and harassment or cruelty. Such evidence is not available on record and so the mere fact that all the members of Darshan Ramâs family were living together at village Mehma Sarja, would not alter the factual situation.

33. Consequently, in the absence of the prosecution proving the ingredients of Section 304-B of the IPC, the initial burden cast on it has not been discharged. Therefore, the presumption under Section 113-B of the Evidence Act cannot be attracted.

Conclusion

34. Based on the evidence available on record (or the lack of it) we have no doubt that the appeal filed by Bhola Ram ought to be allowed. It is accordingly allowed and he is acquitted of the charges against him under Section 304-B and Section 498-A of the IPC in relation to the death of Janki Devi.

35. The appeal is allowed and the conviction and sentence of Bhola Ram is set aside.

Post script

36. What is a little disturbing about this case is that it is illustrative of the slow movement of the wheels of criminal justice delivery. The dowry death took place on 6th September, 1989. The Trial Court pronounced its decision on 3rd December, 1991 within two years of Janki Deviâs death. The first appeal was decided by the High Court on 5th July, 2004 which is more than twelve years later. A petition for special leave to appeal was filed in this Court in 2004 and leave was granted only after a gap of four years in 2008. Thereafter this appeal was listed for hearing as if it is an appeal of 2008 rather than a petition of 2004 thereby wiping away four years of its age in this Court. And even then, it has taken another five years for its disposal, making a total of nine years spent in this Court. It is high time those of us who are judges of this Court and decision makers also become policy makers.

"Markandey Katju, J.

1. Leave granted.

2. Heard learned counsel for the appellant. None has appeared for the respondent although she has been served notice. We had earlier requested Mr. Jayant Bhushan, learned Senior counsel to assist us as Amicus Curiae in the case, and we record our appreciation of Mr. Bhushan who was of considerable assistance to us.

3. These appeals have been filed against the judgment of the Madras High Court dated 12.10.2009.

4. The appellant herein has alleged that he was married according to the Hindu Customary Rites with one Lakshmi on 25.6.1980. Out of the wedlock with Lakshmi a male child was born, who is now studying in an Engineering college at Ooty. The petitioner is working as a Secondary Teacher in Thevanga Higher Secondary School, Coimbatore.

5. It appears that the respondent-D. Patchaiammal filed a petition under Section 125 Cr.P.C. in the year 2001 before the Family Court at Coimbatore in which she alleged that she was married to the appellant herein on 14.9.1986 and since then the appellant herein and she lived together in her father's house for two or three years. It is alleged in the petition that after two or three years the appellant herein left the house of the respondent's father and started living in his native place, but would visit the respondent occasionally.

6. It is alleged that the appellant herein (respondent in the petition under Section 125 Cr.P.C.) deserted the respondent herein (petitioner in the proceeding under Section 125 Cr.P.C.) two or three years after marrying her in 1986. In her petition under Section 125 Cr.P.C. she alleged that she did not have any kind of livelihood and she is unable to maintain herself whereas the respondent (appellant herein) is a Secondary Grade Teacher drawing a salary of Rs.10000/- per month. Hence it was prayed that the respondent (appellant herein) be directed to pay Rs.500/- per month as maintenance to the petitioner.

7. In both her petition under Section 125 Cr.P.C. as well as in her deposition in the case the respondent has alleged that she was married to the appellant herein on 14.9.1986, and that he left her after two or three years of living together with her in her father's house.

8. Thus it is the own case of the respondent herein that the appellant left her in 1988 or 1989 (i.e. two or three years after the alleged marriage in 1986). Why then was the petition under Section 125 Cr.P.C. filed in the year 2001, i.e. after a delay of about twelve years, shall have to be satisfactorily explained by the respondent. This fact also creates some doubt about the case of the respondent herein.

9. In his counter affidavit filed by the appellant herein before the Family Court, Coimbatore, it was alleged that the respondent (appellant herein) was married to one Lakshmi on 25.6.1980 as per the Hindu Marriage rites and customs and he had a male child, who is studying in C.S.I. Engineering college at Ooty. To prove his marriage with Lakshmi the appellant produced the ration card, voter's identity card of his wife, transfer certificate of his son, discharge certificate of his wife Lakshmi from hospital, photographs of the wedding, etc.

10. The learned Family Court Judge has held by his judgment dated 5.3.2004 that the appellant was married to the respondent and not to Lakshmi. These findings have been upheld by the High Court in the impugned judgment.

11. In our opinion, since Lakshmi was not made a party to the proceedings before the Family Court Judge or before the High Court and no notice was issued to her hence any declaration about her marital status vis-`- vis the appellant is wholly null and void as it will be violative of the rules of natural justice. Without giving a hearing to Lakshmi no such declaration could have validly be given by the Courts below that she had not married the appellant herein since such as a finding would seriously affect her rights. And if no such declaration could have been given obviously no declaration could validly have been given that the appellant was validly married to the respondent, because if Lakshmi was the wife of the appellant then without divorcing her the appellant could not have validly married the respondent.

12. It may be noted that Section 125 Cr.P.C. provides for giving maintenance to the wife and some other relatives. The word `wife' has been defined in Explanation (b) to Section 125(1) of the Cr.P.C. as follows :

""Wife includes a woman who has been divorced by, or has obtained a divorce from, her husband and has not remarried.""
13. In Vimala (K) vs. Veeraswamy (K) [(1991) 2 SCC 375], a three- Judge Bench of this Court held that Section 125 of the Code of 1973 is meant to achieve a social purpose and the object is to prevent vagrancy and destitution. Explaining the meaning of the word `wife' the Court held:

""..the object is to prevent vagrancy and destitution. It provides a speedy remedy for the supply of food, clothing and shelter to the deserted wife. When an attempt is made by the husband to negative the claim of the neglected wife depicting her as a kept-mistress on the specious plea that he was already married, the court would insist on strict proof of the earlier marriage. The term `wife' in Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, includes a woman who has been divorced by a husband or who has obtained a divorce from her husband and has not remarried. The woman not having the legal status of a wife is thus brought within the inclusive definition of the term `wife' consistent with the objective. However, under the law a second wife whose marriage is void on account of the survival of the first marriage is not a legally wedded wife, and is, therefore, not entitled to maintenance under this provision.""
14. In a subsequent decision of this Court in Savitaben Somabhat Bhatiya vs. State of Gujarat and others, AIR 2005 SC 1809, this Court held that however desirable it may be to take note of the plight of an unfortunate woman, who unwittingly enters into wedlock with a married man, there is no scope to include a woman not lawfully married within the expression of `wife'. The Bench held that this inadequacy in law can be amended only by the Legislature.

15. Since we have held that the Courts below erred in law in holding that Lakshmi was not married to the appellant (since notice was not issued to her and she was not heard), it cannot be said at this stage that the respondent herein is the wife of the appellant. A divorced wife is treated as a wife for the purpose of Section 125 Cr.P.C. but if a person has not even been married obviously that person could not be divorced. Hence the respondent herein cannot claim to be the wife of the appellant herein, unless it is established that the appellant was not married to Lakshmi.

16. However, the question has also be to be examined from the point of view of The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005. Section 2(a) of the Act states :

""2(a) ""aggrieved person"" means any woman who is, or has been, in a domestic relationship with the respondent and who alleges to have been subjected to any act of domestic violence by the respondent"";
Section 2(f) states :
""2(f) ""domestic relationship"" means a relationship between two persons who live or have, at any point of time, lived together in a shared household, when they are related by consanguinity, marriage, or through a relationship in the nature of marriage, adoption or are family members living together as a joint family"";
Section 2(s) states :
""2(s) ""shared household"" means a household where the person aggrieved lives or at any stage has lived in a domestic relationship either singly or along with the respondent and includes such a household whether owned or tenanted either jointly by the aggrieved person and the respondent, or owned or tenanted by either of them in respect of which either the aggrieved person or the respondent or both jointly or singly have any right, title, interest or equity and includes such a household which may belong to the joint family of which the respondent is a member, irrespective of whether the respondent or the aggrieved person has any right, title or interest in the shared household.""
Section 3(a) states that an act will constitute domestic violence in case it-
""3(a) harms or injures or endangers the health, safety, life, limb or well-being, whether mental or physical, of the aggrieved person or tends to do so and includes causing physical abuse, sexual abuse, verbal and emotional abuse and economic abuse;"" or (emphasis supplied)
17. The expression ""economic abuse"" has been defined to include :
""(a) deprivation of all or any economic or financial resources to which the aggrieved person is entitled under any law or custom whether payable under an order of a court or otherwise or which the aggrieved person requires out of necessity including, but not limited to, household necessities for the aggrieved person and her children, if any, stridhan, property, jointly or separately owned by the aggrieved person, payment of rental related to the shared household and maintenance"".
(emphasis supplied)
18. An aggrieved person under the Act can approach the Magistrate under Section 12 for the relief mentioned in Section 12(2). Under Section 20(1)(d) the Magistrate can grant maintenance while disposing of the application under Section 12(1).
19. Section 26(1) provides that the relief mentioned in Section 20 may also be sought in any legal proceeding, before a civil court, family court or a criminal court.

20. Having noted the relevant provisions in The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, we may point out that the expression `domestic relationship' includes not only the relationship of marriage but also a relationship `in the nature of marriage'. The question, therefore, arises as to what is the meaning of the expression `a relationship in the nature of marriage'. Unfortunately this expression has not been defined in the Act. Since there is no direct decision of this Court on the interpretation of this expression we think it necessary to interpret it because a large number of cases will be coming up before the Courts in our country on this point, and hence an authoritative decision is required.

21. In our opinion Parliament by the aforesaid Act has drawn a distinction between the relationship of marriage and a relationship in the nature of marriage, and has provided that in either case the person who enters into either relationship is entitled to the benefit of the Act.
22. It seems to us that in the aforesaid Act of 2005 Parliament has taken notice of a new social phenomenon which has emerged in our country known as live-in relationship. This new relationship is still rare in our country, and is sometimes found in big urban cities in India, but it is very common in North America and Europe. It has been commented upon by this Court in S. Khushboo vs. Kanniammal & Anr. (2010) 5 SCC 600 (vide para 31).

23. When a wife is deserted, in most countries the law provides for maintenance to her by her husband, which is called alimony. However, earlier there was no law providing for maintenance to a woman who was having a live-in relationship with a man without being married to him and was then deserted by him.

24. In USA the expression `palimony' was coined which means grant of maintenance to a woman who has lived for a substantial period of time with a man without marrying him, and is then deserted by him (see `palimony' on Google). The first decision on palimony was the well known decision of the California Superior Court in Marvin vs. Marvin (1976) 18 C3d660. This case related to the famous film actor Lee Marvin, with whom a lady Michelle lived for many years without marrying him, and was then deserted by him and she claimed palimony. Subsequently in many decisions of the Courts in USA, the concept of palimony has been considered and developed. The US Supreme Court has not given any decision on whether there is a legal right to palimony, but there are several decisions of the Courts in various States in USA. These Courts in USA have taken divergent views, some granting palimony, some denying it altogether, and some granting it on certain conditions. Hence in USA the law is still in a state of evolution on the right to palimony.

25. Although there is no statutory basis for grant of palimony in USA, the Courts there which have granted it have granted it on a contractual basis. Some Courts in USA have held that there must be a written or oral agreement between the man and woman that if they separate the man will give palimony to the woman, while other Courts have held that if a man and woman have lived together for a substantially long period without getting married there would be deemed to be an implied or constructive contract that palimony will be given on their separation.

26. In Taylor vs. Fields (1986) 224 Cal. Rpr. 186 the facts were that the plaintiff Taylor had a relationship with a married man Leo. After Leo died Taylor sued his widow alleging breach of an implied agreement to take care of Taylor financially and she claimed maintenance from the estate of Leo. The Court of Appeals in California held that the relationship alleged by Taylor was nothing more than that of a married man and his mistress. It was held that the alleged contract rested on meretricious consideration and hence was invalid and unenforceable. The Court of Appeals relied on the fact that Taylor did not live together with Leo but only occasionally spent weekends with him. There was no sign of a stable and significant cohabitation between the two.

27. However, the New Jersey Supreme Court in Devaney vs. L' Esperance 195 N.J., 247 (2008) held that cohabitation is not necessary to claim palimony, rather ""it is the promise to support, expressed or implied, coupled with a marital type relationship, that are indispensable elements to support a valid claim for palimony"". A law has now been passed in 2010 by the State legislature of New Jersey that there must be a written agreement between the parties to claim palimony.

28. Thus, there are widely divergent views of the Courts in U.S.A. regarding the right to palimony. Some States like Georgia and Tennessee expressly refuse to recognize palimony agreements.
29. Written palimony contracts are rare, but some US Courts have found implied contracts when a woman has given up her career, has managed the household, and assisted a man in his business for a lengthy period of time. Even when there is no explicit written or oral contract some US Courts have held that the action of the parties make it appear that a constructive or implied contract for grant of palimony existed.

30. However, a meretricious contract exclusively for sexual service is held in all US Courts as invalid and unenforceable.

31. In the case before us we are not called upon to decide whether in our country there can be a valid claim for palimony on the basis of a contract, express or implied, written or oral, since no such case was set up by the respondent in her petition under Section 125 Cr.P.C.

32. Some countries in the world recognize common law marriages. A common law marriage, sometimes called de facto marriage, or informal marriage is recognized in some countries as a marriage though no legally recognized marriage ceremony is performed or civil marriage contract is entered into or the marriage registered in a civil registry (see details on Google).

33. In our opinion a `relationship in the nature of marriage' is akin to a common law marriage. Common law marriages require that although not being formally married :-

(a) The couple must hold themselves out to society as being akin to spouses.
(b) They must be of legal age to marry.
(c) They must be otherwise qualified to enter into a legal marriage, including being unmarried.
(d) They must have voluntarily cohabited and held themselves out to the world as being akin to spouses for a significant period of time.
(see `Common Law Marriage' in Wikipedia on Google) In our opinion a `relationship in the nature of marriage' under the 2005 Act must also fulfill the above requirements, and in addition the parties must have lived together in a `shared household' as defined in Section 2(s) of the Act. Merely spending weekends together or a one night stand would not make it a `domestic relationship'.

34. In our opinion not all live in relationships will amount to a relationship in the nature of marriag8e to get the benefit of the Act of 2005. To get such benefit the conditions mentioned by us above must be satisfied, and this has to be proved by evidence. If a man has a `keep' whom he maintains financially and uses mainly for sexual purpose and/or as a servant it would not, in our opinion, be a relationship in the nature of marriage'

35. No doubt the view we are taking would exclude many women who have had a live in relationship from the benefit of the 2005 Act, but then it is not for this Court to legislate or amend the law. Parliament has used the expression `relationship in the nature of marriage' and not `live in relationship'. The Court in the grab of interpretation cannot change the language of the statute.

36. In feudal society sexual relationship between man and woman outside marriage was totally taboo and regarded with disgust and horror, as depicted in Leo Tolstoy's novel `Anna Karenina', Gustave Flaubert's novel `Madame Bovary' and the novels of the great Bengali writer Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyaya.

37. However, Indian society is changing, and this change has been reflected and recognized by Parliament by enacting The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005.

38. Coming back to the facts of the present case, we are of the opinion that the High Court and the learned Family Court Judge erred in law in holding that the appellant was not married to Lakshmi without even issuing notice to Lakshmi. Hence this finding has to be set aside and the matter remanded to the Family Court which may issue notice to Lakshmi and after hearing her give a fresh finding in accordance with law. The question whether the appellant was married to the respondent or not can, of course, be decided only after the aforesaid finding.

39. There is also no finding in the judgment of the learned Family Court Judge on the question whether the appellant and respondent had lived together for a reasonably long period of time in a relationship which was in the nature of marriage. In our opinion such findings were essential to decide this case. Hence we set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court and Family Court Judge, Coimbatore and remand the matter to the Family Court Judge to decide the matter afresh in accordance with law and in the light of the observations made above. Appeals allowed.",cr
"A.K.SIKRI,J.

1. The present Special Leave Petition has been preferred against the impugned judgment/final order dated 8.10.2013 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in Criminal Miscellaneous Petition No.27343/2013. It was a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as the âCodeâ) for quashing of FIR No.121/14.7.2010 registered under Sections 307/324/323/34,IPC, on the basis of compromise dated 22.7.2013 entered into between the petitioners ( who are accused in the said FIR) and respondent No.2 (who is the complainant). The High Court has refused to exercise its extraordinary discretion invoking the provisions of Section 482 of the Code on the ground that four injuries were suffered by the complainant and as per the opinion of the Doctor, injury No.3 were serious in nature. The High Court, thus, refused to accept the compromise entered into between the parties, the effect whereof would be that the petitioners would face trial in the said FIR.

2. Leave granted.

3. We have heard counsel for the parties at length.

4. It may be stated at the outset that the petitioners herein, who are three in number, have been charged under various provisions of the IPC including for committing offence punishable under Section 307, IPC i.e. attempt to commit murder. FIR No.121/14.7.2010 was registered. In the aforesaid FIR, the allegations against the petitioners are that on 9.7.2010 at 7.00 A.M. while respondent No.2 was going on his motorcycle to bring diesel from village Lapoke, Jasbir Singh, Narinder Singh both sons of Baldev Singh and Baldev Singh son of Lakha Singh attacked him and injured him. Respondent No.2 was admitted in Shri Guru Nanak Dev Hospital, Amritsar. After examination the doctor found four injuries on his person. Injury No.1 to 3 are with sharp edged weapons and injury No.4 is simple. From the statement of injured and MLRâs report, an FIR under sections 323/324/34 IPC was registered. After X-ray report relating to injury No.3, section 307 IPC was added in the FIR

5. After the completion of investigation, challan has been presented in the Court against the petitioners and charges have also been framed. Now the case is pending before the Ld.Trial Court, Amritsar, for evidence.

6. During the pendency of trial proceedings, the matter has been compromised between the petitioners as well as the private respondent with the intervention of the Panchayat on 12.07.2013. It is clear from the above that three years after the incident, the parties compromised the matter with intervention of the Panchayat of the village.

7. It is on the basis of this compromise, the petitioners moved aforesaid criminal petition under section 482 of the Code for quashing of the said FIR. As per the petitioners, the parties have settled the matter, as they have decided to keep harmony between them to enable them to live with peace and love. The compromise records that they have no grudge against each other and the complainant has specifically agreed that he has no objection if the FIR in question is quashed. Further, both the parties have undertaken not to indulge in any litigation against each other and withdraw all the complaints pending between the parties before the court. As they do not intend to proceed with any criminal case against each other, on that basis the submission of the petitioners before the High Court was that the continuance of the criminal proceedings in the aforesaid FIR will be a futile exercise and mere wastage of precious time of the court as well as investigating agencies.

8. The aforesaid submission, however, did not impress the High Court as the medical report depicts the injuries to be of grievous nature. The question for consideration, in these circumstances, is as to whether the court should have accepted the compromise arrived at between the parties and quash the FIR as well as criminal proceedings pending against the petitioner.

9. The ld. counsel for the State has supported the aforesaid verdict of the High Court arguing that since offence under Section 307 is non-compoundable, the respondents could not have been acquitted only because of the reason that there was a compromise/settlement between the parties. In support, the learned counsel for the respondent-State has relied upon the judgment of this Court in the case of Rajendra Harakchand Bhandari vs. State of Maharashtra (2011) 13 SCC 311 wherein this Court held that since offence under Section 307 is not compoundable, even when the parties had settled the matter, compounding of the offence was out of question. Said settlement along with other extenuating circumstances was only taken as the ground for reduction of the sentence in the following manner:

âWe must immediately state that the offence under Section 307 is not compoundable in terms of Section 320(9) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and, therefore, compounding of the offence in the present case is out of question. However, the circumstances pointed out by the learned Senior Counsel do persuade us for a lenient view in regard to the sentence. The incident occurred on 17.5.1991 and it is almost twenty years since then. The appellants are agriculturists by occupation and have no previous criminal background. There has been reconciliation amongst parties; the relations between the appellants and the victim have become cordial and prior to the appellantsâ surrender, the parties have been living peacefully in the village. The appellants have already undergone the sentence of more than two-and-a half years. Having regard to those circumstances, we are satisfied that ends of justice will be met if the substantive sentence awarded to the appellants is reduced to the period already undergone while maintaining the amount of fine.
Consequently, while confirming the conviction of the appellants for the offences punishable under Section 307 read with Section 34, Section 332 read with Section 34 and Section 353 read with Section 34, the substantive sentence awarded to them by the High Court is reduced to the period already undergone. The fine amount and the default stipulation remain as it is.â
10. The learned counsel for the appellant, on the other hand, submitted that merely because an offence is non-compoundable under Section 320 of the Code would not mean that the High Court is denuded of its power to quash the proceedings in exercising its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. He argued that Section 320(9) of the Code cannot limit or affect the power of the High Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. Such a power is recognized by the Supreme Court in catena of judgments. He further submitted that having regard to the circumstances in the present case where the fight had occurred on the spot in the heat of the moment inasmuch as both sides were verbally fighting when the petitioners had struck the victim, this assault was more of a crime against the individual than against the society at large. He further submitted that this Court in Dimpey Gujral v. Union Territory through Administrator 2012 AIR SCW 5333 had quashed the FIR registered under sections 147,148,149,323,307,452 and 506 of the IPC.

11. We find that there are cases where the power of the High Court under Section 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings in those offences which are uncompoundable has been recognized. The only difference is that under Section 320(1) of the Code, no permission is required from the Court in those cases which are compoundable though the Court has discretionary power to refuse to compound the offence. However, compounding under Section 320(1) of the Code is permissible only in minor offences or in non-serious offences. Likewise, when the parties reach settlement in respect of offences enumerated in Section 320(2) of the Code, compounding is permissible but it requires the approval of the Court. In so far as serious offences are concerned, quashing of criminal proceedings upon compromise is within the discretionary powers of the High Court. In such cases, the power is exercised under Section 482 of the Code and proceedings are quashed. Contours of these powers were described by this Court in B.S.Joshi vs. State of Haryana (2003) 4 SCC 675 which has been followed and further explained/elaborated in so many cases thereafter, which are taken note of in the discussion that follows hereinafter.

12. At the same time, one has to keep in mind the subtle distinction between the power of compounding of offences given to Court under Section 320 of the Code and quashing of criminal proceedings by the High Court in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction conferred upon it under Section 482 of the Code. Once, it is found that compounding is permissible only if a particular offence is covered by the provisions of Section 320 of the Code and the Court in such cases is guided solitary and squarely by the compromise between the parties, in so far as power of quashing under Section 482 of the Code is concerned, it is guided by the material on record as to whether the ends of justice would justify such exercise of power, although the ultimate consequence may be acquittal or dismissal of indictment. Such a distinction is lucidly explained by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Gian Singh vs. State of Punjab & Anr. (2012) 10 SCC 303. Justice Lodha, speaking for the Court, explained the difference between the two provisions in the following manner:

âQuashing of offence or criminal proceedings on the ground of settlement between an offender and victim is not the same thing as compounding of offence. They are different and not interchangeable. Strictly speaking, the power of compounding of offences given to a court under Section 320 is materially different from the quashing of criminal proceedings by the High Court in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction. In compounding of offences, power of a criminal court is circumscribed by the provisions contained in Section 320 and the court is guided solely and squarely thereby while, on the other hand, the formation of opinion by the High Court for quashing a criminal offence or criminal proceeding or criminal complaint is guided by the material on record as to whether the ends of justice would justify such exercise of power although the ultimate consequence may be acquittal or dismissal of indictment.
B.S.Joshi, Nikhil Merchant, Manoj Sharma and Shiji do illustrate the principle that the High Court may quash criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent power under Section 482 of the Code and Section 320 does not limit or affect the powers of the High Court under Section 482. Can it be said that by quashing criminal proceedings in B.S.Joshi, Nikhil Merchant, Manoj Sharma and Shiji this Court has compounded the non-compoundable offences indirectly? We do not think so. There does exist the distinction between compounding of an offence under Section 320 and quashing of a criminal case by the High Court in exercise of inherent power under Section 482. The two powers are distinct and different although the ultimate consequence may be the same viz. acquittal of the accused or dismissal of indictment.â
13. Apart from narrating the interplay of Section 320 and Section 482 of the Code in the manner aforesaid, the Court also described the extent of power under Section 482 of the Code in quashing the criminal proceedings in those cases where the parties had settled the matter although the offences are not compoundable. In the first instance it was emphasized that the power under Sec. 482 of the Code is not to be resorted to, if there is specific provision in the Code for redressal of the grievance of an aggrieved party. It should be exercised very sparingly and should not be exercised as against the express bar of law engrafted in any other provision of the Code. The Court also highlighted that in different situations, the inherent power may be exercised in different ways to achieve its ultimate objective. Formation of opinion by the High Court before it exercises inherent power under Section 482 on either of the twin objectives, (i) to prevent abuse of the process of any court, or (ii) to secure the ends of justice, is a sine qua non.

14. As to under what circumstances the criminal proceedings in a non- compoundable case be quashed when there is a settlement between the parties, the Court provided the following guidelines:

âWhere the High Court quashes a criminal proceeding having regard to the facts that the dispute between the offender and the victim has been settled although the offences are not compoundable, it does so as in its opinion, continuation of criminal proceedings will be an exercise in futility and justice in the case demands that the dispute between the parties is put to an end and peace is restored; securing the ends of justice being the ultimate guiding factor. No doubt, crimes are acts which have harmful effect on the public and consist in wrongdoing that seriously endangers and threatens the well-being of the society and it is not safe to leave the crime-doer only because he and the victim have settled the dispute amicably or that the victim has been paid compensation, yet certain crimes have been made compoundable in law, with or without the permission of the court. In respect of serious offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. or other offences of mental depravity under IPC or offences of moral turpitude under special statutes, like the Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants while working in that capacity, the settlement between the offender and the victim can have no legal sanction at all. However, certain offences which overwhelmingly and predominantly bear civil flavor having arisen out of civil, mercantile, commercial, financial, partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony, particularly relating to dowry, etc. or the family dispute, where the wrong is basically to the victim and the offender and the victim have settled all disputes between them amicably, irrespective of the fact that such offences have not been made compoundable, the High Court may within the framework of its inherent power, quash the criminal proceeding or criminal complaint or FIR if it is satisfied that on the face of such settlement, there is hardly any likelihood of the offender being convicted and by not quashing the criminal proceedings, justice shall be casualty and ends of justice shall be defeated. The above list is illustrative and not exhaustive. Each case will depend on its own facts and no hard-
and-fast category can be prescribed.â Thereafter, the Court summed up the legal position in the following words:

âThe position that emerges from the above discussion can be summarized thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under Section 320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plentitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guidelines engrafted in such power viz.: (i) to secure the ends of justice, or (ii) to prevent abuse f the process of any court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and the victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victimâs family and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and have a serious impact on society. Similarly, any compromise between the victim and the offender in relation to the offences under special statutes like the Prevention of Corruption Act, or the offences committed by public servants while working in that capacity, etc.; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavor stand on a different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, the High Court may quash the criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise between the offender and the victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of the criminal case would put the accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words, the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and compromise between the victim and the wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that the criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in the affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding.â
15. The Court was categorical that in respect of serious offences or other offences of mental depravity or offence of merely dacoity under special statute, like the Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by Public Servant while working in that capacity. The mere settlement between the parties would not be a ground to quash the proceedings by the High Court and inasmuch as settlement of such heinous crime cannot have imprimatur of the Court.

16. The question is as to whether offence under Section 307 IPC falls within the aforesaid parameters. First limb of this question is to reflect on the nature of the offence. The charge against the accused in such cases is that he had attempted to take the life of another person (victim). On this touchstone, should we treat it a crime of serious nature so as to fall in the category of heinous crime, is the poser.

17. Finding an answer to this question becomes imperative as the philosophy and jurisprudence of sentencing is based thereupon. If it is heinous crime of serious nature then it has to be treated as a crime against the society and not against the individual alone. Then it becomes the solemn duty of the State to punish the crime doer. Even if there is a settlement/compromise between the perpetrator of crime and the victim, that is of no consequence. Law prohibits certain acts and/or conduct and treats them as offences. Any person committing those acts is subject to penal consequences which may be of various kind. Mostly, punishment provided for committing offences is either imprisonment or monetary fine or both. Imprisonment can be rigorous or simple in nature. Why those persons who commit offences are subjected to such penal consequences? There are many philosophies behind such sentencing justifying these penal consequences. The philosophical/jurisprudential justification can be retribution, incapacitation, specific deterrence, general deterrence, rehabilitation, or restoration. Any of the above or a combination thereof can be the goal of sentencing. Whereas in various countries, sentencing guidelines are provided, statutorily or otherwise, which may guide Judges for awarding specific sentence, in India we do not have any such sentencing policy till date. The prevalence of such guidelines may not only aim at achieving consistencies in awarding sentences in different cases, such guidelines normally prescribe the sentencing policy as well namely whether the purpose of awarding punishment in a particular case is more of a deterrence or retribution or rehabilitation etc.

18. In the absence of such guidelines in India, Courts go by their own perception about the philosophy behind the prescription of certain specified penal consequences for particular nature of crime. For some deterrence and/or vengeance becomes more important whereas another Judge may be more influenced by rehabilitation or restoration as the goal of sentencing. Sometimes, it would be a combination of both which would weigh in the mind of the Court in awarding a particular sentence. However, that may be question of quantum. What follows from the discussion behind the purpose of sentencing is that if a particular crime is to be treated as crime against the society and/or heinous crime, then the deterrence theory as a rationale for punishing the offender becomes more relevant, to be applied in such cases. Therefore, in respect of such offences which are treated against the society, it becomes the duty of the State to punish the offender. Thus, even when there is a settlement between the offender and the victim, their will would not prevail as in such cases the matter is in public domain. Society demands that the individual offender should be punished in order to deter other effectively as it amounts to greatest good of the greatest number of persons in a society. It is in this context that we have to understand the scheme/philosophy behind Section 307 of the Code.

19. We would like to expand this principle in some more detail. We find, in practice and in reality, after recording the conviction and while awarding the sentence/punishment the Court is generally governed by any or all or combination of the aforesaid factors. Sometimes, it is the deterrence theory which prevails in the minds of the Court, particularly in those cases where the crimes committed are heinous in nature or depicts depravity, or lack morality. At times it is to satisfy the element of âemotionâ in law and retribution/vengeance becomes the guiding factor. In any case, it cannot be denied that the purpose of punishment by law is deterrence, constrained by considerations of justice. What, then, is the role of mercy, forgiveness and compassion in law? These are by no means comfortable questions and even the answers may not be comforting. There may be certain cases which are too obvious namely cases involving heinous crime with element of criminality against the society and not parties inter-se. In such cases, the deterrence as purpose of punishment becomes paramount and even if the victim or his relatives have shown the virtue and gentility, agreeing to forgive the culprit, compassion of that private party would not move the court in accepting the same as larger and more important public policy of showing the iron hand of law to the wrongdoers, to reduce the commission of such offences, is more important. Cases of murder, rape, or other sexual offences etc. would clearly fall in this category. After all, justice requires long term vision. On the other hand, there may be, offences falling in the category where âcorrectionalâ objective of criminal law would have to be given more weightage in contrast with âdeterrenceâ philosophy. Punishment, whatever else may be, must be fair and conducive to good rather than further evil. If in a particular case the Court is of the opinion that the settlement between the parties would lead to more good; better relations between them; would prevent further occurrence of such encounters between the parties, it may hold settlement to be on a better pedestal. It is a delicate balance between the two inflicting interests which is to be achieved by the Court after examining all these parameters and then deciding as to which course of action it should take in a particular case.

20. We may comment, at this stage, that in so far as the judgment in the case of Bhandari (supra) is concerned, undoubtedly this Court observed that since offence under Section 307 is not compoundable in terms of Section 320(9) of the Cr.P.C., compounding of the offence was out of question. However, apart from this observation, this aspect is not discussed in detail. Moreover, on reading para 12 of the said judgment, it is clear that one finds that counsel for the appellant in that case had not contested the conviction of the appellant for the offence under Section 307 IPC, but had mainly pleaded for reduction of sentence by projecting mitigating circumstances.

21. However, we have some other cases decided by this Court commenting upon the nature of offence under Section 307 of IPC. In Dimpey Gujral case (supra), FIR was lodged under sections 147,148,149,323,307,552 and 506 of the IPC. The matter was investigated and final report was presented to the Court under Section 173 of the Cr.P.C. The trial court had even framed the charges. At that stage, settlement was arrived at between parties. The court accepted the settlement and quashed the proceedings, relying upon the earlier judgment of this Court in Gian Singh vs. State of Punjab & Anr. 2012 AIR SCW 5333 wherein the court had observed that inherent powers under section 482 of the Code are of wide plentitude with no statutory limitation and the guiding factors are: (1) to secure the needs of justice, or (2) to prevent abuse of process of the court. While doing so, commenting upon the offences stated in the FIR, the court observed:

âSince the offences involved in this case are of a personal nature and are not offences against the society, we had enquired with learned counsel appearing for the parties whether there is any possibility of a settlement. We are happy to note that due to efforts made by learned counsel, parties have seen reason and have entered into a compromise.â This Court, thus, treated such offences including one under section 307, IPC were of a personal nature and not offences against the society.
22. On the other hand, we have few judgments wherein this Court refused to quash the proceedings in FIR registered under section 307 IPC etc. on the ground that offence under section 307 was of serious nature and would fall in the category of heinous crime. In the case of Shiji vs. Radhika & Anr. (2011) 10 SCC 705 the Court quashed the proceedings relating to an offence under section 354 IPC with the following observations:

âWe have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the impugned order. Section 320 of the Cr.P.C. enlists offences that are compoundable with the permission of the Court before whom the prosecution is pending and those that can be compounded even without such permission. An offence punishable under Section 354 of the IPC is in terms of Section 320(2) of the Code compoundable at the instance of the woman against whom the offence is committed. To that extent, therefore, there is no difficulty in either quashing the proceedings or compounding the offence under Section 354, of which the appellants are accused, having regard to the fact that the alleged victim of the offence has settled the matter with the alleged assailants. An offence punishable under Section 394 IPC is not, however, compoundable with or without the permission of the Court concerned. The question is whether the High Court could and ought to have exercised its power under section 482 the said provision in the light of the compromise that the parties have arrived at.â
23. In a recent judgment in the case of State of Rajasthan vs. Shambhu Kewat & Ors. 2013 (14) SCALE 235, this very Bench of the Court was faced with the situation where the High Court had accepted the settlement between the parties in an offence under Section 307 read with Section 34 IPC and set the accused at large by acquitting them. The settlement was arrived at during the pendency of appeal before the High Court against the order of conviction and sentence of the Sessions Judge holding the accused persons guilty of the offence under Section307/34 IPC. Some earlier cases of compounding of offence under Section 307 IPC were taken note of, noticing under certain circumstances, the Court had approved the compounding whereas in certain other cases such a course of action was not accepted. In that case, this Court took the view that High Court was not justified in accepting the compromise and setting aside the conviction. While doing so, following discussion ensued:

âWe find, in this case, such a situation does not arise. In the instant case, the incident had occurred on 30.10.2008. The trial court held that the accused persons, with common intention, went to the shop of the injured Abdul Rashid on that day armed with iron rod and a strip of iron and, in furtherance of their common intention, had caused serious injuries on the body of Abdul Rashid, of which injury number 4 was on his head, which was of a serious nature.
Dr.Rakesh Sharma, PW5, had stated that out of the injuries caused to Abdul Rashid, injury No.4 was an injury on the head and that injury was âgrievous and fatal for lifeâ. PW8, Dr. Uday Bhomik, also opined that a grievous injury was caused on the head of Abdul Rashid. DR. Uday conducted the operation on injuries of Abdul Rashid as a Neuro Surgeon and fully supported the opinion expressed by PW5 Dr. Rakesh Sharma that injury No.4 was âgrievous and fatal for lifeâ.
We notice that the gravity of the injuries was taken note of by the Sessions Court and it had awarded the sentence of 10 years rigorous imprisonment for the offence punishable under Section 307 IPC, but not by the High Court. The High Court has completely overlooked the various principles laid down by this Court in Gian Singh (Supra), and has committed a mistake in taking the view that, the injuries were caused on the body of Abdul Rashid in a fight occurred at the spur and the heat of the moment. It has been categorically held by this Court in Gian Singh (supra) that the Court, while exercising the power under Section 482, must have âdue regard to the nature and gravity of the crimeâ and âthe social impactâ. Both these aspects were completely overlooked by the High Court. The High Court in a cursory manner, without application of mind, blindly accepted the statement of the parties that they had settled their disputes and differences and took the view that it was a crime against âan individualâ, rather than against âthe society at largeâ.
We are not prepared to say that the crime alleged to have been committed by the accused persons was a crime against an individual, on the other hand it was a crime against the society at large. Criminal law is designed as a mechanism for achieving social control and its purpose is the regulation of conduct and activities within the society. Why Section 307 IPC is held to be non-compoundable, because the Code has identified which conduct should be brought within the ambit of non-compoundable offences. Such provisions are not meant, just to protect the individual, but the society as a whole. High Court was not right in thinking that it was only an injury to the person and since the accused persons had received the monetary compensation and settled the matter, the crime as against them was wiped off. Criminal justice system has a larger objective to achieve, that is safety and protection of the people at large and it would be a lesson not only to the offender, but to the individuals at large so that such crimes would not be committed by any one and money would not be a substitute for the crime committed against the society. Taking a lenient view on a serious offence like the present, will leave a wrong impression about the criminal justice system and will encourage further criminal acts, which will endanger the peaceful co-existence and welfare of the society at large.â
24. Thus, we find that in certain circumstances, this Court has approved the quashing of proceedings under section 307,IPC whereas in some other cases, it is held that as the offence is of serious nature such proceedings cannot be quashed. Though in each of the aforesaid cases the view taken by this Court may be justified on its own facts, at the same time this Court owes an explanation as to why two different approaches are adopted in various cases. The law declared by this Court in the form of judgments becomes binding precedent for the High Courts and the subordinate courts, to follow under Article 141 of the Constitution of India. Stare Decisis is the fundamental principle of judicial decision making which requires âcertaintyâ too in law so that in a given set of facts the course of action which law shall take is discernable and predictable. Unless that is achieved, the very doctrine of stare decisis will lose its significance. The related objective of the doctrine of stare decisis is to put a curb on the personal preferences and priors of individual Judges. In a way, it achieves equality of treatment as well, inasmuch as two different persons faced with similar circumstances would be given identical treatment at the hands of law. It has, therefore, support from the human sense of justice as well. The force of precedent in the law is heightened, in the words of Karl Llewellyn, by âthat curious, almost universal sense of justice which urges that all men are to be treated alike in like circumstancesâ.

25. As there is a close relation between the equality and justice, it should be clearly discernible as to how the two prosecutions under Section 307 IPC are different in nature and therefore are given different treatment. With this ideal objective in mind, we are proceeding to discuss the subject at length. It is for this reason we deem it appropriate to lay down some distinct, definite and clear guidelines which can be kept in mind by the High Courts to take a view as to under what circumstances it should accept the settlement between the parties and quash the proceedings and under what circumstances it should refrain from doing so. We make it clear that though there would be a general discussion in this behalf as well, the matter is examined in the context of offences under Section 307 IPC.

26. The two rival parties have amicably settled the disputes between themselves and buried the hatchet. Not only this, they say that since they are neighbours, they want to live like good neighbours and that was the reason for restoring friendly ties. In such a scenario, should the court give its imprimatur to such a settlement. The answer depends on various incidental aspects which need serious discourse.

The Legislators has categorically recognized that those offences which are covered by the provisions of section 320 of the Code are concededly those not only do not fall within the category of heinous crime but also which are personal between the parties. Therefore, this provision recognizes whereas there is a compromise between the parties the Court is to act at the said compromise and quash the proceedings. However, even in respect of such offences not covered within the four corners of Section 320 of the Code, High Court is given power under Section 482 of the Code to accept the compromise between the parties and quash the proceedings. The guiding factor is as to whether the ends of justice would justify such exercise of power, both the ultimate consequences may be acquittal or dismissal of indictment. This is so recognized in various judgments taken note of above.

27. In the case of Dimpey Gujral (supra), observations of this Court to the effect that offences involved in that case were not offences against the society. It included charge under Section 307 IPC as well. However, apart from stating so, there is no detained discussion on this aspect. Moreover, it is the other factors which prevailed with the Court to accept the settlement and compound he offence, as noted above while discussing this case. On the other hand, in Shambhu Kewat (supra), after referring to some other earlier judgments, this Court opined that commission of offence under Section 307 IPC would be crime against the society at large, and not a crime against an individual only. We find that in most of the cases, this view is taken. Even on first principle, we find that an attempt to take the life of another person has to be treated as a heinous crime and against the society.

28. Having said so, we would hasten to add that though it is a serious offence as the accused person(s) attempted to take the life of another person/victim, at the same time the court cannot be oblivious to hard realities that many times whenever there is a quarrel between the parties leading to physical commotion and sustaining of injury by either or both the parties, there is a tendency to give it a slant of an offence under Section 307 IPC as well. Therefore, only because FIR/Charge-sheet incorporates the provision of Section 307 IPC would not, by itself, be a ground to reject the petition under section 482 of the Code and refuse to accept the settlement between the parties. We are, therefore, of the opinion that while taking a call as to whether compromise in such cases should be effected or not, the High Court should go by the nature of injury sustained, the portion of the bodies where the injuries were inflicted (namely whether injuries are caused at the vital/delicate parts of the body) and the nature of weapons used etc. On that basis, if it is found that there is a strong possibility of proving the charge under Section 307 IPC, once the evidence to that effect is led and injuries proved, the Court should not accept settlement between the parties. On the other hand, on the basis of prima facie assessment of the aforesaid circumstances, if the High Court forms an opinion that provisions of Section 307 IPC were unnecessary included in the charge sheet, the Court can accept the plea of compounding of the offence based on settlement between the parties.

29. At this juncture, we would like also to add that the timing of settlement would also play a crucial role. If the settlement is arrived at immediately after the alleged commission of offence when the matter is still under investigation, the High Court may be somewhat liberal in accepting the settlement and quashing the proceedings/investigation. Of course, it would be after looking into the attendant circumstances as narrated in the previous para. Likewise, when challan is submitted but the charge has not been framed, the High Court may exercise its discretionary jurisdiction. However, at this stage, as mentioned above, since the report of the I.O. under Section 173,Cr.P.C. is also placed before the Court it would become the bounding duty of the Court to go into the said report and the evidence collected, particularly the medical evidence relating to injury etc. sustained by the victim. This aspect, however, would be examined along with another important consideration, namely, in view of settlement between the parties, whether it would be unfair or contrary to interest of justice to continue with the criminal proceedings and whether possibility of conviction is remote and bleak. If the Court finds the answer to this question in affirmative, then also such a case would be a fit case for the High Court to give its stamp of approval to the compromise arrived at between the parties, inasmuch as in such cases no useful purpose would be served in carrying out the criminal proceedings which in all likelihood would end in acquittal, in any case.

30. We have found that in certain cases, the High Courts have accepted the compromise between the parties when the matter in appeal was pending before the High Court against the conviction recorded by the trial court. Obviously, such cases are those where the accused persons have been found guilty by the trial court, which means the serious charge of Section 307 IPC has been proved beyond reasonable doubt at the level of the trial court. There would not be any question of accepting compromise and acquitting the accused persons simply because the private parties have buried the hatchet.

31. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we sum up and lay down the following principles by which the High Court would be guided in giving adequate treatment to the settlement between the parties and exercising its power under Section 482 of the Code while accepting the settlement and quashing the proceedings or refusing to accept the settlement with direction to continue with the criminal proceedings:

(I) Power conferred under Section 482 of the Code is to be distinguished from the power which lies in the Court to compound the offences under Section 320 of the Code. No doubt, under Section 482 of the Code, the High Court has inherent power to quash the criminal proceedings even in those cases which are not compoundable, where the parties have settled the matter between themselves. However, this power is to be exercised sparingly and with caution.

(II)When the parties have reached the settlement and on that basis petition for quashing the criminal proceedings is filed, the guiding factor in such cases would be to secure:

(i) ends of justice, or

(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court.

While exercising the power the High Court is to form an opinion on either of the aforesaid two objectives.

(III) Such a power is not be exercised in those prosecutions which involve heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are not private in nature and have a serious impact on society. Similarly, for offences alleged to have been committed under special statute like the Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by Public Servants while working in that capacity are not to be quashed merely on the basis of compromise between the victim and the offender.

(IV) On the other, those criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominantly civil character, particularly those arising out of commercial transactions or arising out of matrimonial relationship or family disputes should be quashed when the parties have resolved their entire disputes among themselves.

(V) While exercising its powers, the High Court is to examine as to whether the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal cases would put the accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal cases.

(VI) Offences under Section 307 IPC would fall in the category of heinous and serious offences and therefore is to be generally treated as crime against the society and not against the individual alone. However, the High Court would not rest its decision merely because there is a mention of Section 307 IPC in the FIR or the charge is framed under this provision. It would be open to the High Court to examine as to whether incorporation of Section 307 IPC is there for the sake of it or the prosecution has collected sufficient evidence, which if proved, would lead to proving the charge under Section 307 IPC. For this purpose, it would be open to the High Court to go by the nature of injury sustained, whether such injury is inflicted on the vital/delegate parts of the body, nature of weapons used etc. Medical report in respect of injuries suffered by the victim can generally be the guiding factor. On the basis of this prima facie analysis, the High Court can examine as to whether there is a strong possibility of conviction or the chances of conviction are remote and bleak. In the former case it can refuse to accept the settlement and quash the criminal proceedings whereas in the later case it would be permissible for the High Court to accept the plea compounding the offence based on complete settlement between the parties. At this stage, the Court can also be swayed by the fact that the settlement between the parties is going to result in harmony between them which may improve their future relationship.

(VII) While deciding whether to exercise its power under Section 482 of the Code or not, timings of settlement play a crucial role. Those cases where the settlement is arrived at immediately after the alleged commission of offence and the matter is still under investigation, the High Court may be liberal in accepting the settlement to quash the criminal proceedings/investigation. It is because of the reason that at this stage the investigation is still on and even the charge sheet has not been filed. Likewise, those cases where the charge is framed but the evidence is yet to start or the evidence is still at infancy stage, the High Court can show benevolence in exercising its powers favourably, but after prima facie assessment of the circumstances/material mentioned above. On the other hand, where the prosecution evidence is almost complete or after the conclusion of the evidence the matter is at the stage of argument, normally the High Court should refrain from exercising its power under Section 482 of the Code, as in such cases the trial court would be in a position to decide the case finally on merits and to come a conclusion as to whether the offence under Section 307 IPC is committed or not. Similarly, in those cases where the conviction is already recorded by the trial court and the matter is at the appellate stage before the High Court, mere compromise between the parties would not be a ground to accept the same resulting in acquittal of the offender who has already been convicted by the trial court. Here charge is proved under Section 307 IPC and conviction is already recorded of a heinous crime and, therefore, there is no question of sparing a convict found guilty of such a crime.

32. After having clarified the legal position in the manner aforesaid, we proceed to discuss the case at hand.

33. In the present case, FIR No.121 dated 14.7.2010 was registered under Section 307/324/323/34 IPC. Investigation was completed, whereafter challan was presented in the court against the petitioner herein. Charges have also been framed; the case is at the stage of recording of evidence. At this juncture, parties entered into compromise on the basis of which petition under Section 482 of the Code was filed by the petitioners namely the accused persons for quashing of the criminal proceedings under the said FIR. As per the copy of the settlement which was annexed along with the petition, the compromise took place between the parties on 12.7.2013 when respectable members of the Gram Panchayat held a meeting under the Chairmanship of Sarpanch. It is stated that on the intervention of the said persons/Panchayat, both the parties were agreed for compromise and have also decided to live with peace in future with each other. It was argued that since the parties have decided to keep harmony between the parties so that in future they are able to live with peace and love and they are the residents of the same village, the High Court should have accepted the said compromise and quash the proceedings.s",cr
"This is an application under section 482 of Cr.P.C.

filed by the petitioners Hrushi @ Hrusikesh Behera, Sashi Behera, Ghasi Mohanandia and Nabina Mahanandia challenging the impugned order dated 10.12.2004 passed by the learned S.D.J.M., Boudh in I.C.C. Case No. 38 of 2004 in taking cognizance of offences under sections 323/450/354/506(ii)/376 read with sections 511/34 of the Indian Penal Code and directing issuance of process against them.

The opp. party earlier filed a complaint petition in the Court of learned S.D.J.M., Boudh against the petitioners which was registered as I.C.C. Case No. 35 of 2004 for taking of cognizance of offences under sections 450/ 376/ 511/ 354/ 323/ 506(ii)/34 of the Indian Penal Code. The learned S.D.J.M. recorded the initial statement of the complainant in which she stated that on 13.10.2004 at about 1.00 p.m. the occurrence took place inside her house and at that time she was present alone in her house and her husband and other family members were absent from the house and the petitioners forcibly entered in the house and petitioner no.3 Ghasi Mahanandia assaulted her and other three petitioners made her naked and thereafter the petitioner no.1 took off her saya, made her lie down and committed sexual intercourse. When she raised hulla, her uncle- in-law came to the spot and informed her husband after he returned from Baghiapada weekly market. She further stated in the initial statement that the petitioner no.4 Nabina Mahanandia assaulted to her husband by split wood and thereafter the accused persons left the spot and her husband sustained injury on his chest and arm and her blouse was torn and bangles were broken and she sustained injuries on her both hands. She further stated that she lodged a written report before the Inspector-in- charge of Boudh police station but since the police did not take any legal action against the petitioners, she filed the complaint petition. After the initial statement was recorded on 01.11.2004, the learned S.D.J.M., Boudh decided to conduct inquiry under section 202 Cr.P.C. and on 19.11.2004 the advocate for the complainant filed a memo that the complainant does not want to adduce/produce witnesses for inquiry, accordingly, the memo was accepted. The learned S.D.J.M., Boudh held that the allegation is under sections 453/454/323/506/376 read with section 511 of the Indian Penal Code which is under sessions trial and accordingly dismissed the complaint petition under section 203 Cr.P.C. vide order dated 19.11.2004.

The opp. party-complainant filed another complaint petition relating to the self-same set of facts against the petitioners before the learned S.D.J.M., Boudh which was registered as I.C.C. case No. 38 of 2004 for taking cognizance of offences under sections 450/376/511/354/323/506/34 of the Indian Penal Code and in that complaint petition, she has mentioned about the filing of the earlier complaint petition and also its dismissal on 19.11.2004 under section 203 Cr.P.C. She stated in the complaint petition that since she failed to produce her witnesses, the same was dismissed under section 203 Cr.P.C. After filing of the second complaint petition, the complainant was examined and her initial statement was recorded on 24.11.2004 and thereafter one witness namely Kusa Jagadala was examined by the complainant in the inquiry under section 202 Cr.P.C. on 30.11.2004 and on 07.12.2004 another witness namely Keshab Urma was examined. The learned S.D.J.M., Boudh after perusing the complaint petition, the statement of the complainant and the witnesses examined during inquiry under section 202 Cr.P.C. found prima facie case under sections 323/450/354/506(ii)/376 read with sections 511/34 of the Indian Penal Code against the petitioners and accordingly took cognizance of such offences and issued process which is impugned in this application under section 482 Cr.P.C.

Mr. N.P. Pattnaik, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners contended that the impugned order dated 10.12.2004 passed by the learned S.D.J.M., Boudh suffers from non- application of mind and when the first complaint petition filed by the opp.party-complainant on the self same set of facts was dismissed under section 203 Cr.P.C. by him in I.C.C. Case No. 35 of 2004, the second complaint petition should not have been entertained. It is stated that the order dated 19.11.2004 passed by the learned S.D.J.M., Boudh in I.C.C. case No. 35 of 2004 has reached finality and it was not challenged by the opp.party in any higher forum and therefore, the learned Magistrate was not justified in entertaining the second complaint petition.

In spite of issuance of notice to the opp. party- complainant and A.D. returned after valid service, none appears on her behalf.

The question that crops up consideration is whether in the facts and circumstances of the case when the first complaint petition filed by the opp. party was dismissed on 19.11.2004 under section 203 Cr.P.C. in I.C.C. case No. 35 of 2004, the second complaint petition on the self same set of facts is maintainable or not?

Section 203 Cr.P.C. enumerates how a complaint petition filed by the complainant can be dismissed.

A Magistrate may dismiss the complaint under section 203 Cr.P.C. on three grounds. In the first place, if he, upon the statements made by the complainant and his witnesses, reduced to writing under section 200, finds no offence has been committed; in the second place, if he distrusts the complainant and his witnesses' statements; and in the third place, if he conducts an inquiry or direct for investigation under section 202 Cr.P.C. and considering the result of the inquiry or investigation coupled with the statements of the complainant and his witnesses, he is not satisfied that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused, the Magistrate may dismiss the complaint. At the time of dismissing the complaint petition, the Magistrate shall briefly record his reasons for so doing. It may not be an elaborate one but it should reflect the minimum reasons for passing such an order.

Section 203 Cr.P.C. consists of two parts, the first part lays down the materials which the Magistrate must consider and the second part states that if after considering those materials, there is no sufficient ground for proceeding; the Magistrate may dismiss the complaint. Therefore, while exercising such power under section 203 of the Code, it is incumbent upon the Magistrate to reflect in his order, the basis for arriving at the conclusion that there are no sufficient grounds to proceed with the complaint case.

So far as the maintainability of the second complaint after the dismissal of the first one, it is held in case of Pramatha Nath Talukdar -Vrs.- Saroj reported in A.I.R. 1962 S.C. 876, that an order of dismissal under Section 203 Cr.P.C. is, no bar to the entertainment of a second complaint on the same facts but it can be entertained only in exceptional circumstances i.e. (a) where the previous order was passed on incomplete record or (b) on a misunderstanding of the nature of the complaint or (c) the order which was passed was manifestly absurd, unjust or foolish or(d) where new facts which could not, with reasonable diligence, have been brought on the record in the previous proceedings.

In case of Jatindra Singh -Vrs.- Ranjit Kaur reported in A.I.R. 2001 S.C.784, it is held that if the dismissal of the complaint was not on merit but on default of the complainant to be present, there is no bar in the complainant moving the Magistrate again with a second complaint on the same facts. But if the dismissal of the complaint under Section 203 of the Code was on merits, the position would be different as settled in case of Pramath Nath (Supra).

In case of Mahesh Chand -Vrs.- B. Janardhan Reddy reported in A.I.R. 2003 S.C. 702, it was held in a case where a previous complaint is dismissed without assigning any reasons, on a subsequent complaint, the Magistrate under section 204 Cr.P.C. may take cognizance of an offence and issue process if there is sufficient ground for proceeding. Second complaint could be dismissed after a decision has been given against the complainant in previous matter upon a full consideration of his case.

In case of Ranvir Singh -Vrs.- State of Haryana reported in (2000) 9 Supreme Court Cases 642, the question came up for consideration as to whether a second complaint would be maintainable when the earlier one had not been dismissed on merits, but for the failure of the complainant to put in process fees for effecting service, Hon'ble Court relying upon Pramath Nath Talukdar's case (supra) held that even if a complaint was dismissed under section 203 Cr.P.C., a second complaint would still lie under exceptional circumstances.

In case of Poonam Chand Jain -Vrs.- Fazru, reported in 2010(1) Orissa Law Reviews (SC) 517 where the question cropped up for determination was whether after an order of dismissal of complaint attaining finality, the complainant can file another complaint on almost identical facts without disclosing in the second complaint the fact of either filing of the first complaint or its dismissal, the Hon'ble Court relying upon the decision rendered in case of Pramatha Nath (supra) held that the second complaint was on almost identical facts which was raised in the first complaint and which was dismissed on merits. So the second complaint was not maintainable. It was further held that nothing has been disclosed in the second complaint which is substantially new and not disclosed in first complaint and no case was made out that even after the exercise of due diligence, the facts alleged in the second complaint were not within the knowledge of the first complainant.

In case of Shiv Shankar Singh -Vrs.- State of Bihar reported in 2012 (I) Crimes 16, it is held that the law does not prohibit filing or entertaining of the second complaint even on the same facts provided the earlier complaint has been decided on the basis of insufficient material or the order has been passed without understanding the nature of the complaint or the complete facts could not be placed before the Court or where the complainant came to know certain facts after disposal of the first complaint which could have tilted the balance in his favour. However, second complaint would not be maintainable wherein the earlier complaint has been disposed of on full consideration of the case of the complainant on merit.

On going through the ratio laid down in the aforesaid decisions and looking at the earlier order passed by the learned S.D.J.M., Boudh dated 19.11.2004 passed in I.C.C. Case No. 35 of 2004, it is clear that the dismissal of the complaint petition was not on merit. When the complainant filed a memo that he does not want to adduce/produce witnesses for inquiry, the memo was accepted and holding the case to be one of sessions trial, the complaint petition was dismissed. The learned Magistrate has not gone through the complaint petition or initial statement which was available with him at that stage to find out whether prima facie case is made out or not or whether there is sufficient ground for proceeding or not. When ""all his witnesses"" appearing in the proviso to sub-section (2) of section 202 of Cr.P.C. has to be construed to mean ""all witnesses which the complainant chooses to examine"" and the complainant in this case choose not to adduce/produce any witnesses for inquiry, the Magistrate should not have dismissed the complaint petition on that ground holding it to be a sessions trial without scrutinizing the complaint petition and the initial statement of the complainant to see whether there is sufficient ground for proceeding or not. In such a contingency, when the second complaint petition was filed and the complainant examined herself and her initial statement was recorded and two witnesses were also examined on her behalf in the inquiry contemplated under section 202 Cr.P.C. and after going through the complaint petition, the initial statement and the statements of the witnesses recorded under section 202 Cr.P.C., the learned Magistrate found prima facie case under sections 323/450/354/506(ii)/376 read with sections 511/34 of the Indian Penal Code and issued process against the petitioner, it cannot be said that the learned Magistrate has committed any illegality in passing the impugned order.

Therefore, I am not able to accept the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner and accordingly, this application under section 482 Cr.P.C. being devoid of merit stands dismissed.",cr
"M.R. Shah, J.

Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 24.12.2018 passed by the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad in Criminal Miscellaneous Application No. 1 of 2018 in Special Criminal Application No. 8704 of 2018, by which the High Court has dismissed the said application preferred by the appellant herein permitting him to be joined as respondent No. 4 in the said Special Criminal Application No. 8704 of 2018, which was filed by the private Signature Not Verified Digitally signed by MEENAKSHI KOHLI Date: 2020.03.02 respondent herein seeking further investigation against other persons (other than 15:22:41 IST Reason:

the appellant who is one of the accused and is already charge-sheeted), the appellant has preferred the present appeal.

2. The facts leading to the present appeal in nutshell are as under:

That in an earthquake on 26.01.2001, number of buildings collapsed, including the building named Shikhar Apartment situated at Village Vejalpur, Ahmedabad. That due to the collapse of the said Shikhar apartment, 98 persons died. That the private respondent herein-the victim lodged the FIR, being CR No. I-58 of 2001 with the Satellite Police Station against the appellant and others for the offences punishable under Sections 304, 418, 420 and 114 of IPC and Section 3(2)(c)&(d), Section 7(1)(i)(ii)2 and Section 42 of the Gujarat Ownership of Flats and for contravention of GDCR, Building Bye-laws. That the Police Inspector, Satellite Police Station filed the charge-sheet against the appellant and others on 02.05.2001 for the aforesaid offences. It appears that after a number of rounds of litigations, the appellant and some of the other accused came to be charge-sheeted. However, three accused persons, namely, Yagnesh Vyas, Sanjay Shah and Ronak Shah were not charge-sheeted. The matter was carried up to this Court by way of Criminal Appeal No. 1426 of 2017. It appears that during the hearing of the aforesaid appeal by this Court, there was progress in the investigation and the charge-sheet was filed against the accused Yagnesh Vyas and Sanjay Shah who were also arrested. Therefore, while disposing of the aforesaid Criminal Appeal No. 1426 of 2017 vide order dated 16.07.2018, this Court observed that if the private respondent herein-the Victim has any objection against dropping of one another accused, he may file objection and can file a protest petition in the Trial Court. This Court also observed that the private respondent herein-the Victim can also carry out proceedings in an appropriate Court against one Shri M. N. Bhaumik for not prosecuting him. That, thereafter the private respondent herein-the Victim filed an application before the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ahmedabad (Rural) under Sections 173(8) and 156(3) CrPC for further investigation against Shri Bhaumik. That by order dated 29.08.2018, learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ahmedabad (Rural) dismissed the said application on merits as well as on the ground that after the charge-sheet is filed, the Magistrate has no jurisdiction to order for further investigation under Section 173(8) CrPC. 2.1 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the order passed by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate dated 29.08.2018 passed in an application below Ex.275(C) in Criminal Case No. 853 of 2001, the private respondent herein has preferred the Special Criminal Application No. 8704 of 2018 before the High Court of Gujarat. In the said Special Criminal Application, the appellant herein, one of the accused who is already charge-sheeted, submitted an application permitting him to be joined as party respondent No. 4 in the said Special Criminal Application. By the impugned Judgment and Order, Judge of the High Court has dismissed the said application. Hence, the present appeal.

3. Shri Maninder Singh, learned Senior Advocate has appeared on behalf of the appellant; the private respondent herein has appeared as a party-in-person and Mr. Aniruddha P. Mayee, learned Advocate has appeared on behalf of the respondent- State of Gujarat.

3.1 Shri Maninder Singh, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case the High Court has committed grave error in refusing to implead the appellant-co- accused as a party in the writ petition filed by the victim. 3.2 It is further submitted by Shri Maninder Singh, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant that the High Court has not properly appreciated and considered the fact that, as held by this Court in the case of Athul Rao v. State of Karnataka (2018) 14 SCC 298 at the behest of a person who is not complainant seeking direction of further investigation is not maintainable. 3.3 It is further submitted by the learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant that even as already held by this Court in the case of Amrutbhai Shambhubhai Patel v. Sumanbhai Kantibhai Patel (2017) 4 SCC 177, the complainant does not have any right to file an application under Section 173(8) CrPC once the charge-sheet is framed. It is submitted that in the present case the charge-sheet is already filed and the evidence of the complainant has been recorded and therefore the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate was justified in rejecting the application for further investigation under Section 173(8) CrPC preferred by the private respondent herein. It is submitted that if the opportunity would have been given to the appellant by permitting the appellant to be impleaded as a party respondent in the Special Criminal Application, the appellant could have pointed out the aforesaid aspects and submit the case on merits.

3.4 It is submitted that, even otherwise, looking to the allegations in the writ petition before the High Court, as the private respondent herein has made allegations against the investigating agency that the investigation is not carried out by the investigating officer properly, the appellant being accused is a necessary and proper party and in his absence, effective adjudication of the subject-matter of the dispute may not take place.

3.5 Number of other submissions have been made by the learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant on merits of the application submitted by the private respondent herein for further investigation under Section 173(8) CrPC. However, for the reasons stated hereinbelow, and as the main Special Criminal Application against the order passed by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate rejecting an application submitted by the private respondent herein for further investigation under Section 173(8) CrPC is pending consideration by the High Court, we do not propose to go into the merits of the application submitted by the private respondent herein for further investigation under Section 173(8) CrPC. 3.6 Shri Maninder Singh, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant has also heavily relied upon Rule 51 of the Gujarat High Court Rules, 1993 in support of his submissions that as per Rule 51 all parties to the proceedings from which the appeal or application arises shall be made the parties to the appeal or application. It is submitted that therefore also and as the appellant herein was a party to the Criminal Case No. 853 of 2001 in fact the private respondent herein ought to have impleaded the appellant in the special criminal application.

4. The present appeal is vehemently opposed by the private respondent herein as well Shri Mayee, learned Advocate appearing for the State of Gujarat. 4.1 It is vehemently submitted that in an application under Section 173(8) CrPC for further investigation with respect to one another accused namely Shri Bhaumik, the appellant has no locus as the appellant as such is already charge-sheeted and the trial against him is going on. It is submitted that in the Special Criminal Application the private respondent herein has challenged the order passed by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate rejecting the application under Section 173(8) CrPC which was basically made with respect to one another accused Shri Bhaumik as he was not charge-sheeted, the appellant herein cannot be said to be a necessary and/or proper party, It is submitted that even the appellant also cannot be said to be a affected party even if the Special Criminal Application is allowed and the application for further investigation under Section 173(8) CrPC against Shri Bhaumik is allowed.

4.2 It is further submitted that being a proposed accused even Shri Bhaumik has no locus and/or say at this stage for further investigation under Section 173(8) CrPC.

In support of the above, reliance is placed upon the decision of this Court in Dinubhai Baghabhai Solanki v. State of Gujarat (2014) 4 SCC 626; Narender G. Goel v. State of Maharashtra (2009) 6 SCC 65 and Union of India v. W. N. Chadha 1993 Supp (4) SCC 260. It is submitted that therefore when the proposed accused has no locus and/or say at this stage, the appellant, who as such is already charge-sheeted, and the trial against him is proceeded further, and against him no relief is sought while submitting the application under Section 173(8) CrPC shall not have any locus or say. It is submitted that therefore the High Court has rightly refused to implead the appellant as a party respondent in the petition filed by the private respondent herein.

5. Shri Mayee, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the State of Gujarat has also opposed the present appeal as well as the application submitted by the appellant herein before the High Court and vehemently submitted that the appellant being one of the co-accused who is already charge-sheeted and against whom the trial has proceeded further has no locus and/or say in the petition filed by the private respondent herein as, even otherwise, the appellant cannot be said to even the affected party as while submitting the application under Section 173(8) CrPC no relief is sought against the appellant and the relief is sought for one another co- accused namely Shri Bhaumik, who is yet not charge-sheeted.

6. Heard learned counsel appearing for the respective parties at length. 6.1 At the outset, it is required to be noted that the present proceedings arise out of the application submitted by the private respondent herein seeking further investigation under Section 173(8) CrPC against one Mr. Bhaumik who is yet not charge-sheeted. Learned Chief Judicial Magistrate dismissed the said application against which the private respondent herein has approached the High Court by way Special Criminal Application. In the said petition, the appellant herein- one of the co-accused who is already charge-sheeted and against whom the trial is in progress and though in an application under Section 173(8) CrPC no relief is sought against him, submitted an application to implead him as respondent in the said Special Criminal Application and the said application has been dismissed by the High Court by the impugned Judgment and Order. Therefore, the short question which is posed for consideration of this Court is whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, the appellant-one of the co-accused against whom the charge-sheet is already filed and against whom the trial is in progress, is required to be heard and/or has any locus in the proceedings under Section 173(8) CrPC â further investigation qua one another accused namely Shri Bhaumik against whom no charge-sheet has been filed till date?

7. Having heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties and the private respondent herein, we are of the opinion that as such no error has been committed by the High Court dismissing the application submitted by the appellant herein to implead him in the Special Criminal Application filed by the private respondent herein challenging the order passed by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate rejecting his application for further investigation under Section 173(8) CrPC with respect to one another accused namely Shri Bhaumik against whom no charge-sheet has been filed till date. Therefore, it is not at all appreciable how the appellant against whom no relief is sought for further investigation has any locus and/or any say in the application for further investigation under Section 173(8) CrPC. How he can be said to be a necessary and a proper party. It is required to be noted that, as such, even the proposed accused Shri Bhaumik shall not have any say at this stage in an application under Section 173(8) CrPC for further investigation, as observed by this Court in the case of W.N. Chadha (supra); Narender G. Goel (supra) and Dinubhai Baghabhai Solanki (supra). In the case of Dinubhai Baghabhai Solanki (supra) after considering one another decision of this Court in the case of Sri Bhagwan Samardha v. State of A.P. (1999) 5 SCC 740, it is observed and held that there is nothing in Section 173(8) CrPC to suggest that the court is obliged to hear the accused before any direction for further investigation is made. In Sri Bhagwan Samardha (supra), this Court in paragraph 11 held as under:

â11. In such a situation the power of the court to direct the police to conduct further investigation cannot have any inhibition. There is nothing in Section 173(8) to suggest that the court is obliged to hear the accused before any such direction is made. Casting of any such obligation on the court would only result in encumbering the court with the burden of searching for all the potential accused to be afforded with the opportunity of being heard. As the law does not require it, we would not burden the Magistrate with such an obligation.â Therefore, when the proposed accused against whom the further investigation is sought, namely Shri Bhaumik is not required to be heard at this stage, there is no question of hearing the appellant-one of the co-accused against whom the charge-
sheet is already filed and the trial against whom is in progress and no relief of further investigation is sought against him. Therefore, the High Court is absolutely justified in rejecting the application submitted by the appellant to implead him as a party respondent in the Special Criminal Application.

8. Now, so far as the reliance placed upon Rule 51 of the Gujarat High Court Rules by the learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant is concerned, we are of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the case, Rule 51 shall not have any application for further investigation under Section 173(8) CrPC. Proceedings arising out of an application under Section 173(8) CrPC cannot be equated with the appeal or application against the order passed in criminal case as stated in Rule 51. Therefore Rule 51 of the Gujarat High Court Rules has no application at all.

8. In view of the above and for the reasons stated hereinabove, there is no substance in the present appeal and the same deserves to be dismissed and is accordingly dismissed.",cr
"SURINDER SINGH NIJJAR, J.

1. Leave granted.

2. This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and order dated 30th March, 2005 passed in the Writ Petition No. 8606 of 2004 by the High Court of Bombay, by which the writ petition against the order of dismissal of the petitioner from service dated 19th July, 2003 and the order passed by the Appellate Authority on 27th July, 2004 affirming the said order of the dismissal was dismissed in limine.

3. Before adverting to the facts leading to the filing of the present appeal, we must notice that the petitioner Mr. Avinash Sadashiv Bhosale died during the pendency of this appeal. His legal heirs have been brought on record, in his place. However, for the sake of convenience, he shall be referred to as Mr. Bhosale or as the appellant whichever is appropriate.

4. It appears that Mr. Bhosale joined the services of respondent No.2 Bank as a Probationary Officer on 31st July, 1975. He was confirmed as an Officer in Junior Management Grade ScaleâI on 31st July, 1977. In course of time, he was promoted to Middle Management Scale-II (August, 1984). Thereafter, he was further promoted as Officer in Middle Management ScaleâIII in August, 1994. In course of time, he was posted as the Branch Manager at Washi Turbhe branch on 31st January, 1998 and was officiating in the Senior Management Scale-IV.

5. Whilst he was working at Washi Turbhe branch, it was discovered that the branch had indulged in fraudulent transactions to the tune of Rs. 12 crores. On 8th July, 1998, the appellant was relieved from the branch of the aforesaid bank, presumably due to his alleged involvement in the said transactions. On 16th July, 1998, he apparently reported the fraud to the Crime Branch, CBD, Belapur, Navi Mumbai. The A.G.M. in charge of the Region IV, State Bank of India, Zonal Office, Mumbai was also informed. In the complaint made to the police, he had requested that the culprits who are involved in the fraud be identified. He had also asked the police to initiate suitable action against the culprits in accordance with law.

6. It is claimed by Mr. Bhosale that instead of taking action on the complaint submitted by him, the A.G.M. on 22nd July, 1998 wrote to the police indicating that the appellant had no locus standi to file the complaint. It was stated that Mr. Bhosale âis not an authorised person to lodge a complaint on behalf of the Bank, since he himself is involved in the alleged offence in the above matter.â As noticed earlier, the appellant was relieved from the Branch on 8th July, 1998. He had protested that he had an excellent and unblemished service record in the Bank for the past 23 years. He maintained that he was entirely innocent and did not commit any breach of the service regulations of the bank. He pointed out that he proceeded on leave on account of sickness on 26th March 1998 and also that he was mostly either on leave or on some outdoor assignment duties during the period immediately preceding the detection of the said fraudulent transactions. Further, it has been claimed that certain officials in the Bank in connivance with each other committed fraud by purchasing cheques without his knowledge.

7. The appellant was suspended from service on 23rd July, 1998 alongwith one Mr. Yadneshwar Choudhary. However, the latter was soon reinstated in service as he was not made a co-accused in the criminal proceedings initiated against Mr. Bhosale and three other co-accused.

8. It appears that after completion of investigation by the police, the appellant was prosecuted for having committed the offences punishable under Sections 120(B), 420, 467, 468, 471 and 201 of Indian Penal Code alongwith three others who were the account holders. By judgment dated 4th December, 2001, Mr. Bhosale and the other co-accused were acquitted of all the charges.

9. Simultaneously to the criminal proceedings, the respondent bank had initiated departmental proceedings against Mr. Bhosale. He was served a charge sheet dated 14th January, 2000 containing articles of charge and statement of imputation of misconduct in terms of Rule 68(2)(iii) of the State Bank of India Officers Service Rules, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as the â1992 Rulesâ). In the aforesaid charge sheet certain specific and serious allegations have been made against Mr. Bhosale. The statement of imputation alleges that after his transfer at Washi Turbhe Branch on 31st January, 1998 from Rabala Trans Thane Creek Branch, he permitted M/s Kalgindar Construction Company Pvt. Ltd. to open a current account at Washi Turbhe Branch without completing the required formalities. Further, the account was allegedly opened with a view to accommodate the said construction company at a later date by executing the fictitious Demand Draft (D.D.) purchase transactions. The statement of imputation thereafter tabulates the departure from established norms which are to be observed by the Bank for DD purchase. It is alleged that Mr. Bhosale indiscriminately and without any justification authorised D.D. purchase of 11 cheques aggregating to Rs.5,51,51,070/- drawn in favour of M/s Kalgindar Construction Company Pvt. Ltd. and presented by it for credit of proceeds thereof to its Current Account. All the cheques so discounted except one for Rs.5 lacs were beyond the discretionary powers vested in Mr. Bhosale. While allowing D.D. purchases, no D.D. purchase limit was fixed for the said construction company, nor was the genuineness of the transactions or credentials of the parties ascertained by Mr. Bhosale. All the D.D. purchase transactions in question were also not reported to the Controllers. The high value cheques were allowed to be handed over to the representative of the said construction Company, instead of dispatching them to the Bankâs branch located at the centre by Regd. A.D. Post. This deliberate action of Mr. Bhosale facilitated the said construction company to perpetrate a fraud on the Bank as the said cheques did not reach the drawee Banks.

10. Charge No.2 narrates a similar incident where Mr. Bhosale allowed M/s. Kumar Constructions Company, a proprietory firm, to open a current account on 15th June, 1998 without making enquiries of antecedents of the proprietor and completing the other required formalities with a malafide intention to accommodate the aforesaid company at a later date by allowing fictitious D.D. purchase of cheques. Thereafter, the actual details of the D.D. purchase are tabulated.

11. The third Charge in the list of allegation relates to M/s. Kalani Builders and Developers Pvt. Ltd., dealing in construction business. The aforesaid company submitted a proposal prepared by a Chartered Accountant for being extended credit facilities. Based on the aforesaid proposal, Mr. Bhosale sanctioned cash credit limit of Rs.20 lacs (fund based) and Rs.20 lacs (non-fund based). All this was done by him without making independent enquiries, carrying out pre-sanction survey, arranging visits by the field officer or by himself, properly scrutinizing and appraising the proposal, compiling an opinion report on the borrowers and the guarantors and obtaining recommendations of the field officer. Mr. Bhosale, within a period of one month from the date of sanction of cash credit limit on 1st June, 1998 permitted D.D. purchase of a high value cheque for Rs.31,00,980/-, which was beyond his discretionary powers. He had not ascertained the genuineness of the large value D.D. purchase transaction nor made enquiries about the credentials of the drawer of the cheque. He also allowed cash withdrawals of Rs.30 lacs. Further, he directed the Dispatch Clerk to hand over the said purchased cheque to the representative of the said company for dispatching it to the drawee Bank instead of dispatching it by Regd. A.D. Post. Charge No. 3(iii) alleges that on 9th May, 1998, Mr. Bhosale issued a Letter of Credit for Rs.19,87,000/- on behalf of M/s. Kalani Builders Pvt. Ltd., without proper scrutiny/assessment of the required particulars. Even the counter guarantee was not obtained, nor was it ensured that obligations of the said company would be met on due date. Due to his reckless financing and allowing D.D. purchase to M/s. Kalani Builders and Developers Pvt. Ltd., the Bank suffered a huge financial loss to the extent of Rs.70 lacs. He wanted to conceal the facts of his irregular financing and, therefore, he did not obtain prior sanction of the Controllers or reported for post facto confirmation of the Controllers.

12. Charge No.4 alleges that Mr. Bhosale indiscriminately sanctioned loan aggregating to Rs.56.43 lacs to 19 borrowers under âBig Buy Scheme for purchase of vehicles during 30th April, 1998 to 1st June, 1998.â In these transactions, quantum of loans was to be related to the income of the borrowers. However, this basic factor was totally neglected.

13. Charge No. 5 points to the expenditure of Rs. 4.35 lacs incurred by Mr. Bhosale during the period from March, 1998 to June, 1998 for carrying out repairs to Bankâs Property and providing furniture at the Branch. This was done without inviting any competitive quotations and without seeking approval from the Controlling Authority.

14. Charge No.6 relates to 86 bills of stationery items amounting to Rs.1.16 lacs. Here again, the expenditure was incurred without seeking sanction from the Controlling Authority. On the basis of the aforesaid allegations, it was held that Mr. Bhosale failed to discharge his duty with utmost integrity, honesty, devotion and diligence to ensure and protect the interest of the Bank and acted in a manner in violation of Rule 50(4) of the 1992 Rules.

15. Thereafter, the enquiry proceedings were initiated against Mr. Bhosale. Mr. P.P. Thomas, Officer, Senior Management Grade Scale-V was appointed as the Inquiry Officer on 30th June, 2000. The preliminary hearings of the inquiry were scheduled to be held on 7th September, 2001 and 25th September, 2001, none of which were attended by Mr. Bhosale, despite being reminded in advance by the Inquiry Officer. Consequently, the preliminary hearing proceedings were held ex-parte. The regular hearing of the inquiry was scheduled for 17th January, 2002. Again, Mr. Bhosale expressed his inability to attend the same on account of sickness. The hearing of the inquiry was, therefore, postponed to 18th March, 2002, whereupon the regular hearing was conducted by the Inquiry Officer, in the presence of the presenting officer Mr. D.R. Bapat and Mr. Bhosale. The entire evidence, including the statement of Mr. Suresh Mahadeva Mahale was recorded in the presence of Mr. Bhosale. Mr. Mahale was working as a dispatcher at Washi Turbhe Branch during the period when the irregularities were committed thereat. Further, both Mr. Bhosale and the presenting officer were directed to submit their respective written briefs. Consequently, the presenting officer submitted a brief on 8th April, 2002, whereas Mr. Bhosale submitted his brief on 6th June, 2002.

16. Finally, the Inquiry Officer submitted his report on 19th August, 2002, whereby it was held that all the charges have been proved against Mr. Bhosale. A copy of the Inquiry Officerâs report was made available to Mr. Bhosale for his submissions. It appears from the record that Mr. Bhosale had submitted a detailed defence to the findings of the Inquiry Officer. Ultimately, the Disciplinary Authority in its Order dated 19th July 2003 rejected all the pleas raised in defence by the appellant. Upon careful examination of the entire material on record, the disciplinary authority passed the following effective order:-

âThe C.O. has also contended that the I.A. has not taken into consideration the acquittal of the C.O. in the criminal case as a sufficient and judicial proof of there being no misconduct on his part. He has further stated that the I.A. has not considered the fact finding reports compiled by the Bank officials S/S. Vasant Karve and Mukand Joshi, which have not implicated the C.O. for the lapses mentioned in the charge sheet served on him.

The Court has acquitted the C.O. of offences punishable under Indian Penal Code, whereas the departmental action is for his misconduct in terms of Rules 66 of the SBIOSR.

The above submissions have no relevance to the allegations inasmuch as the allegations levelled against the C.O. have been inquired by the I.A. in the departmental enquiry as per the procedures adopted / in-vogue in departmental enquiry. Reasonable opportunity was given to the C.O. to put up his defence before the I.A. After evaluating the evidence brought before the inquiry, the I.A. has held the allegations as proved.

On a careful examination and consideration, the submissions of the C.O. are found to be not convincing and hence not acceptable. I, therefore, considering the case in its entirety in my capacity as the Disciplinary and Appointing Authority, hold all the allegations and the charge as a whole as âProvedâ on sufficient and acceptable evidence. The proven allegations are very serious in nature which have exposed the Bank to substantial financial loss. The proven misconduct evidently speaks of lack of honesty and integrity on the part of the Charged Officer. Considering all the facts and circumstances of the case, I am of the view that retaining the officer in the Bankâs Service is fraught with grave risks. I, therefore, consider that imposition of penalty of âDismissalâ under rule 67(j) of the State Bank of India Officers Service Rules on Shri A. S. Bhosale, Officer, MMGS III (under suspension), would meet the ends of justice, treating the period of suspension undergone by the official, as such. I order accordingly.

The C.O. may, if he so desires, prefer an appeal against this order to the Appellate Authority within 45 days from the date of receipt thereof in terms of Rule 69(1) and (2) ibid.â

17. Against the aforesaid order of dismissal, Mr. Bhosale preferred a statutory appeal on 19th August, 2003 under the 1992 Rules. Upon consideration of the submissions made by Mr. Bhosale in the appeal by Order dated 27th February, 2004, the Appellate Authority (Chief General Manager) dismissed the same. The relevant observations made by the Appellate Authority are as under:-

âI have examined the entire records of the case and on the basis thereof observe as under, seriatim:

i) The contentions of the appellant are without basis. The entire inquiry process has been correctly followed and fair opportunity has been provided to the appellant to defend himself.

ii) The Inquiry Authority in his report has unequivocally stated that the preliminary hearing, which was to be held on 17th August, 2001 was postponed to the 7th September, 2001, due to the charged officialâs absence. Later the hearing scheduled for 7th September, 2001 was also postponed to 25th September, 2001, for the same reasons. The appellantâs submission that the Inquiring Authority was biased therefore has no basis.

iii) The appellantâs contention seems to be an after thought since in the Regular hearing on the 18th March, 2002, the appellant did not raise objections on this count. Moreover, during the hearing, the appellant confirmed having received these documents (presenting Officerâs exhibits).

iv) It is apparent from the inquiry proceedings that the defence was provided a fair opportunity to defend itself. The appellantâs attempt to cry foul at this juncture is therefore not valid.

v) This argument of the appellant does not have any basis. The charge sheet had clearly outlined these details.

vi) The process followed in a departmental inquiry is distinctly different from that followed in a proceedings before the court. The appellantâs contention is therefore not acceptable.

vii) The appellant cannot disclaim responsibility on this count.

As the head of the Branch, he should have ensured that the Bankâs instruction relating to dispatch of instruments (DD Purchased) should have been meticulously followed. Moreover, PW-1 (the dispatch clerk) has confirmed in the proceedings held on 18th March, 2002 that the covers containing the instruments were delivered at the behest of the appellant.

viii) The Inquiring Authorityâs conclusion that the initials on the Demand Liability Register were those of the appellant is supported by reasoned logic. The Inquiring Authority has lucidly portrayed as to how he reached such a conclusion.

ix) a) Allegation 1 (i) & (ii) :

The appellant cannot disown the fact that cheques were purchased for large amounts. He further cannot disassociate himself by stating that other officers permitted the withdrawals in the account. Moreover, the officials who permitted these withdrawals had done so, on the basis of the credit balance available in the account(s).

b) Allegation 1(iii) :

In addition to stating that the cheques were delivered to the beneficiary at the instructions of Shri Balkawade, the witness had affirmed that these were also delivered at the behest of the appellant. His contention that the prosecution did not introduce key witness is irrelevant.

c) Allegation 1(iv) :

The submission of the appellant has no basis.

d) Allegation 2(i) and (ii) :

It has been proved in the inquiry that DD Purchases were authorised by the appellant. His attempt to pass the responsibility to officials who passed the withdrawals in the account is not appreciated. Further, it is a fact that tee account was not properly introduced.

e) Allegation2(iii), (iv) and (v) :

The appellant is merely trying to raise vague issues. As already stated earlier, the Inquiry Authority has very aptly concluded that the initials in the Demand Liability Register were that of the appellant.

f) Allegation 3 :

By merely stating that the documents were in the custody of the Field Officer, the appellant cannot disclaim responsibility. It was also open to the appellant to produce the field Officer as a defence witness.

g) Allegation 4:

The allegation have been proved based on the documentary evidence produced by the Presenting Officer in the course of the inquiry proceeding. The appellant has during the regular hearing held on 18th March, 2002 confirmed having verified the documents. His contention that no document was produced in the inquiry is therefore incorrect.

h) Allegation 5 :

The allegation has been proved based on documentary evidence. Splitting of Bills has been proved from the fact that 111 bills were paid in respect of 7 items of expenditure.

i) Allegation 6 :

The allegation was proved based on documentary evidence. From the evidence brought out in the inquiry it is apparent that the appellant split bills pertaining to stationery items, in order to ensure that the amount of the split bills falls within his discretionary powers.

x) Although there has been some delay in the issuance of the charge sheet, the appellantâs claim that it had amounted to denial of opportunity to establish his innocence is not maintainable.

xi) The Honourable Court had acquitted the appellant on the subject matter of criminal conspiracy. The appellant cannot draw a parallel between the findings of the departmental proceedings and the Courtâs verdict.

Having so considered the various points brought out in the appeal, I am of the view that the appellant has not been able to put forth any convincing point of merit. The appellant has committed serious and grave irregularities. There is therefore no scope for modification of the penalty imposed on him. I therefore reject the appeal and order accordingly.â

18. Mr. Bhosale challenged the orders passed by the Disciplinary Authority as well as the Appellate Authority by filing Writ Petition No. 8606 of 2004 in the High Court of Judicature at Bombay by Order dated 30th March, 2005. The writ petition was dismissed by a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in limine. The aforesaid Order of the High Court is challenged by Mr. Bhosale in this appeal.

19. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length.

20. Mr. Sushil Kumar Jain, learned counsel appearing for the appellant submits that the disciplinary proceedings conducted against Mr. Bhosale are vitiated as he was acquitted by the Criminal Court. All the offences for which Mr. Bhosale was tried, and then acquitted by the criminal court, were founded on the facts which form the basis of the departmental enquiry. It has been emphasized that the departmental proceedings ought to have been stayed during the pendency of the criminal trial. Once the appellant had been acquitted by the trial court in its judgment dated 4th December, 2001, the appellant ought to have been reinstated forthwith.

21. Mr. Jain submits that continuation of departmental proceedings after the appellant was acquitted in the criminal trial is in violation of the principle underlying Article 20(2) of the Constitution of India. He argues that the statement of imputations of misconduct clearly show that the foundational facts on which the criminal charges were based are also the facts forming the basis of the charges levelled against the appellant. The learned counsel made a detailed and elaborate reference to the findings recorded by the learned Magistrate, in support of the submissions that there was clearly no evidence against the appellant on the basis of which the charges could be said to have been proved.

22. He pointed out that the learned trial court after considering the entire evidence on record has held and observed as under :-

â18â¦â¦â¦â¦If at all any foul play was played at the time of purchasing the cheques, persons like witness no.12 Yadneshwar Choudhary and others were responsible for it who were passing the cheques and putting their signatures. Instead of prosecuting such persons, prosecution has made them witnesses. In this way, when these persons are themselves at fault in the episode, naturally they will try to save their own skin when entered in the witness box therefore their evidence carries least evidentiary value.

23â¦â¦..Sufficient evidence has come on record that during the period of transactions effected in between accused Nos.1, 3 and 4 with the aggrieved bank, all these bank officers were working in the bank and were taking active participation. If really any guilt is committed why all these persons are left at liberty by the prosecution and how they can be believed in the court. It has come on record that P.W. No.12 Yadneshwar Choudhary is suspended from his service only because of this case. Neither the Bank Officers nor the police is coming forward to make such a person accused in the case.

28â¦â¦â¦..Mr. Bhave is very specific in stating that if the despatch clerk fails to follow this practice, he is personally liable for the breach. Admittedly, the accused No.2 never issued any direction in writing to the despatch clerk to give the cheques by hand delivery.

30â¦â¦â¦Witness No.7 Suresh Mahadik who is despatch clerk himself is responsible and faulty in discharging his duty.

Witness No.10 Vinayak Kadam, witness No.11 Arun Balakawade, witness No.12 Yadneshwar Choudhary are all employees of the same bank where the incident has taken place. Not only this, but they actively participated in the transaction in question. Therefore to save their own skin, they may blame the Branch Manager. As such their evidence cannot be believed.â

23. Relying on the aforesaid observations, Mr. Jain submitted that the entire departmental proceedings are vitiated as the appellant has been made scapegoat for the misconduct committed by other employees of the bank who were acting in connivance with each other. According to Mr. Jain, the fraud could not have been committed unless there was connivance at every level from the Clerk to the Deputy Manager. It is for this reason that Yadneshwar Chaudhary was reinstated in service and then used as a witness against the appellant. Mr. Jain emphasised that inspite of efforts made by the respondent-Bank the learned Judicial Magistrate had clearly held that there is no evidence of criminal conspiracy against the appellant. Hence, he was acquitted of the offences punishable under Section 120-B IPC with the following observations :-

âIn the result, I come to a firm conclusion that the accused are entitled to get clean chit in the matterâ.

24. Mr. Jain also pointed out to certain other observations made by the learned Magistrate to demonstrate that the enquiry proceedings are vitiated by legal mala-fides as the same were initiated and conducted against the appellant with the oblique purpose of shielding the real culprits. He points out to the observations made by the trial court to demonstrate that there was no breach of the service regulations. It is pointed out by the learned trial court that the bank had failed to place on record any rule which would show that the appellant was empowered to purchase a cheque only to the extent of Rs.6 lacs. The trial court further pointed out that the bank had also not placed on record any document or resolution to prove that there was a limit of Rs.6 lacs for purchase of cheques by the appellant. The trial court further observed that:-

âIf there was really any such rule then how all the bank officers actively participated in the process of purchasing cheques against or contrary to such so-called rule. Even the bank officers who have stepped in the witness Box did not feel shy to state that they are not fully conversant with banking rules.â

25. The learned trial court also adverted to the evidence of Witness No.16 as follows :-

â20. Witness No.16 Vinay Bhave who is Senior Officer of the bank working as a Regional Manager. He also in his examination-in- chief itself stated that he used to receive weekly reports of all the branches on every Friday including the branch in question, and he used to scrutinize the reports. If this gentleman was scrutinizing the reports on every Friday, how and why he kept mum when the cheques of more than Rupees 6,00,000/- were purchased in the concerned bank. This witness has tried to shift responsibility upon another bank officer named Shri Karve.â

26. The learned trial court further pointed out that the Bank rules were not known even to the other Senior Officers. Mr. Jain has made a reference to the observations made by the learned trial court whilst considering the evidence of PW-11, Arun Balkawade, who was a Senior Officer of the bank. In fact, he was next in the designation to the Chief Manager of Washi Turbhe branch at the material time. Even this witness admitted that he does not know fully all the rules and regulations regarding D.D. purchase of cheques. Learned trial court also concluded that since the other bank employee had actively participated in the fraudulent transactions, their statements could not be relied upon. Summing up the entire evidence, learned trial court had come to a firm conclusion that the accused are entitled to get âclean chitâ in the matter. Relying on the aforesaid observations, Mr. Jain submitted that the acquittal of the appellant is proof of the total inability of the bank to produce any evidence in the trial. The appellant was acquitted as there was no evidence of culpability against him.

27. Relying on a number of judgments of this Court, Mr. Jain has submitted that the submissions made by the appellant before the Disciplinary Authority have been totally ignored without any basis. According to Mr. Jain, the Departmental Enquiry conducted against the appellant was an eye wash. In the Departmental Enquiry, the bank examined only one witness PW-7, Suresh Mahadik, who has been disbelieved by the criminal court. Such a witness who has been proved to be not truthful could not have been relied upon, in the departmental enquiry. He points out that the criminal court recorded a categorical finding that there is no evidence to connect any particular officer with the non-completion of the proper documentation. In the face of such a finding, the Inquiry Officer, without any basis recorded the finding that the charge was proved against the appellant. Similarly, the evidence of Suresh Mahadik having been ignored by the learned trial court, no reliance could have been placed on the same by the Inquiry officer. Mr. Jain further pointed out that in the departmental enquiry, the bank had failed to produce any document or evidence by leading oral evidence. All the documents were merely placed on record by an employee of the bank. Mr. Jain further pointed out that the bias of the inquiry officer as well as the bank is obvious from the fact that all the employees involved in the completion of the transactions were neither prosecuted nor proceeded against departmentally. On the other hand, these individuals have been examined as prosecution witnesses. Having been acquitted, there was no justification for the bank to hold a departmental enquiry on the same facts and on the basis of same evidence.

28. Mr. Jain then submitted that the order passed by the appellate authority is vitiated as it has been passed with a closed mind. None of the submissions made by the appellant in the written submissions have been considered by the appellate authority. Further more, the submissions which have been considered have not been considered on the basis of the relevant material which was placed before the appellate authority.

29. In support of these submissions, Mr. Jain relied on some judgments of this Court which are as follows:-

Roop Singh Negi Vs. Punjab National Bank & Ors.[1], Calcutta Dock Labour Board & Ors. Vs. Jaffar Imam[2], Subhash Chand Vs. State of Rajasthan[3], Omar Salay Mohd Sait Vs. Commissioner of Income Tax, Madras[4], Union of India Vs. H.C. Goel[5], Narinder Mohan Arya Vs. United India Insurance Co. Ltd. & Ors.[6], G.M. Tank Vs. State of Gujarat & Ors.[7], Union of India & Ors. Vs. Naman Singh Shekhawat[8], Capt. M. Paul Anthony Vs. Bharat Gold Mines Ltd. & Anr.[9], Sawai Singh Vs. State of Rajasthan[10], and Pritam Singh & Anr. Vs. State of Punjab[11].

30. Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi, learned senior counsel appearing for respondent Nos. 2 to 5 has submitted that acquittal in a criminal case is not a bar for holding departmental proceedings against the bank official. Learned counsel pointed out that the proceedings before the criminal trial are different in nature to the proceedings in a Departmental Enquiry. Whereas prosecution had to prove the guilt of the accused in the criminal trial beyond reasonable doubt, in the departmental enquiry, the standard of proof is only preponderance of probabilities. Mr. Dwivedi further submitted that the appellant cannot take any advantage of non-production of the relevant evidence by the prosecution in the trial. The lapse committed by the prosecuting agency cannot be attributed to the bank. Further more, in the prosecution, the emphasis was on the involvement of individuals in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the bank. In the departmental proceedings, charges levelled against the appellant are that he has failed to maintain absolute devotion to duty. The charges were that he had disregarded the provisions of the bank regulations. Therefore, two proceedings cannot be placed in the same category. Mr. Dwivedi pointed out that, at the relevant time, the hierarchy in the Branch put the Branch Manager at the top. Below him were the Field Officer, Accountant, Cashier, Dispatch Clerk and a Peon. As a Branch Manager, the appellant was the controller of all the affairs of the branch. He had to ensure that all necessary precautions had been taken to prevent any loss being caused to the bank. The learned senior counsel pointed out that the appellant was in-charge of a small branch. Therefore, had he exercised due care and caution, such a massive fraud could not have taken place. Therefore, there was no overlap between the criminal proceedings and the departmental proceedings. In the criminal trial, the prosecution had to prove that the appellant was guilty beyond reasonable doubt that he had conspired with the other officials of the Bank to commit the offences with which he had been charged. In the departmental proceedings, the enquiry was to investigate as to whether the appellant had performed his duties as a Branch Manager in strict adherence to the procedural rules/regulations of the Bank. He, therefore, refutes the submission of Mr. Jain that there is any infringement of any principle underlying Article 20(2) of the Constitution of India. In support of his submissions, Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi relied on the judgment of this Court in Divisional Controller, Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation Vs. M.G.Vittal Rao.[12]

31. Answering the objections raised by Mr. Jain with regard to the conduct of the departmental enquiry, Mr. Dwivedi pointed out that all documents were duly produced and proved during the enquiry proceedings. The prosecution had failed to produce the relevant documents during the criminal trial. During the Departmental Enquiry, the appellant was asked to verify about the authenticity of the documents. At no stage, the appellant complained about their lack of authenticity. The appellant only made one statement during the departmental enquiry that his initials for purchase of the demand drafts had not been proved. Mr. Dwivedi pointed out to the procedural lapses committed by the appellant. The authenticity of the documents produced in the enquiry not having been doubted by the appellant, the findings of the Inquiry Officer can not be said to be based on no evidence. The appellant was aware that his limit for purchase of a cheque was Rs.6 lacs. Any purchase above Rs.6 lacs could only be done with the prior approval of the higher authorities. The appellant failed to take any prior approval from the higher authorities. In fact, the appellant never informed the higher authorities even after the transactions had been completed. Mr. Dwivedi pointed out that the transactions involved were so heavy, the appellant could not have failed to notice the irregularities. This would lead to a clear inference that either the appellant was acting in connivance with the account holders who were benefitted or he was grossly negligent in performance of his duties. Mr. Dwivedi then pointed out that once the appellant knew that the whole fraud has been exposed, he rushed to make a complaint to the police. Since by that time the higher officials had suspicion with regard to the conduct of the appellant, the police was informed not to act upon the complaint made by him. The actions of the appellant were in violation of Rules 48(4), 48(9), 66 and 67.

32. We have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties. We are not at all impressed by the submissions made by Mr. Jain.

33. We may, however, briefly notice the ratio of the judgments relied upon by the learned counsel.

34. In Roop Singh Negiâs case (supra), this Court has reiterated the well known principle of law that findings of the Enquiry Officer have to be based on some relevant evidence. It is further re-stated that the orders passed by the disciplinary authority and the appellate authority, must also be supported by relevant reasons. The principles are stated thus :

â23. Furthermore, the order of the disciplinary authority as also the appellate authority are not supported by any reason. As the orders passed by them have severe civil consequences, appropriate reasons should have been assigned. If the enquiry officer had relied upon the confession made by the appellant, there was no reason as to why the order of discharge passed by the criminal court on the basis of selfsame evidence should not have been taken into consideration. The materials brought on record pointing out the guilt are required to be proved. A decision must be arrived at on some evidence, which is legally admissible. The provisions of the Evidence Act may not be applicable in a departmental proceeding but the principles of natural justice are. As the report of the enquiry officer was based on merely ipse dixit as also surmises and conjectures, the same could not have been sustained. The inferences drawn by the enquiry officer apparently were not supported by any evidence. Suspicion, as is well known, however high may be, can under no circumstances be held to be a substitute for legal proof.â",cr
"(28/02/2020) Per Rajeev Kumar Shrivastava, J.:

This order shall govern the disposal of Misc. Criminal Case No. 1257/2020 (Mahabir Prasad Jain and Others vs. State of MP) and Misc. Criminal Case No. 2844/2020 (H.D. Joshi and Another vs. State of MP), as both the petitions are filed for getting similar relief.

2. Misc. Cri. Case No. 1257/2020 has been filed against the order dated 14.11.2019 and Misc. Cri. Case No. 2844/2020 has been filed against the order dated 13.3.2019, both passed by Special Judge under Prevention of Corruption Act, Gwalior in

-( 2 )- MCRC No. 1257/2020 MCRC No. 2844/2020 Case No. 03/2020 SST. By both impugned orders the applications filed by the petitioners for their discharge for want of sanction have been rejected.

3. Facts of the case, in short, are that a criminal case has been registered against the officers of Harsi High Level Sindh Project Phase-II of Government of M.P. and also against the officers of LNU/Federation of State of MP on the allegation of financial irregularity during the period between 2006 to 2010 and Crime No. 29/2009 was registered. In FIR the allegations were made with regard to corruption in purchase, supply and erection of material/apparatus by officers of aforesaid Project for getting monetary benefit. After due investigation, charge-sheet was filed for the offences punishable under Sections 409, 420, 467, 468, 471, 120B of IPC read with Section 13(1)(D), 13(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (for brevity, the 'PC Act').

4. The petitioners filed applications alleging that the petitioners are retired government servants, who retired after attaining age of superannuation from Water Resources Department. Charge sheet was filed after the date of superannuation of the petitioners. The petitioner were retired in the year 2008 and charge sheet has been filed without prior sanction under Section 197 of CrPC and Section 19 of PC Act.

5. Learned counsel for the petitioners has contended that the impugned orders are not in accordance with law and are against the settled principles of law, hence liable to be set aside. The petitioners are public servants. The Trial Judge has failed to consider the fact of prior sanction under Section 197 of CrPC and Section 19 of PC Act. In support of his version, learned counsel for the petitioners has placed reliance on the judgments in the cases of N.K.Ganguly vs. CBI [(2016) 2 SCC 143] and Baijnath

-( 3 )- MCRC No. 1257/2020 MCRC No. 2844/2020 Gupta vs. State of MP [AIR 1966 SC 220].

6. Learned counsel for the petitioners has contended that as no sanction was obtained by the respondent at the time of filing of charge sheet against the petitioners, the Court could not take cognizance in the matter, even charges could not be framed in absence of sanction. The petitioners were discharging their official duties, therefore, they are having shield of Section 197 of CrPC. The trial Court has erred in rejecting the application on the basis of amendment in the PC Act having effect of procedural sound and not substantial and applicability of law retrospectively has been considered wrongly. Hence, prayed to set aside the impugned orders.

7. Learned Special Public Prosecutor has opposed the submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioners and urged that procurement of prosecution sanction is only essential where, the charge-sheet is filed against a retired government servant for the offences under the Indian Penal Code, committed by the public servant while discharging his official duty. He contended that no sanction is required for prosecuting a public servant or retired public servant for the offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act if he has superannuated and ceased to be a public servant before submission of charge-sheet. On these grounds, he implored the Court to dismiss the petition.

8. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the arguments advanced and have gone through the material available on record.

9. Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows :

""197. Prosecution of Judges and public
-( 4 )- MCRC No. 1257/2020 MCRC No. 2844/2020 servants.--(1) When any person who is or was a Judge or Magistrate or a public servant not removable from his office save by or with the sanction of the Government is accused of any offence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty, no Court shall take cognizance of such offence except with the previous sanction save as otherwise provided in the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013--
(a) in the case of a person who is employed or, as the case may be, was at the time of commission of the alleged offence employed, in connection with the affairs of the Union, of the Central Government;

Explanation.--For the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that no sanction shall be required in case of a public servant accused of any offence alleged to have been committed under section 166A, section 166B, section 354, section 354A, section 354B, section 354C, section 354D, section 370, section 375, section 376, 5 [section 376A, section

(2) No Court shall take cognizance of any offence alleged to have been committed by any member of the Armed Forces of the Union while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty, except with the previous sanction of the Central Government.

(3) The State Government may, by notification, direct that the provisions of sub-section (2) shall apply to such class or category of the members of the Forces charged with the maintenance of public order as may be specified therein, wherever they may be serving, and thereupon the provisions of that sub-section will apply as if for the expression ""Central Government"" occurring therein, the expression ""State Government"" were substituted.

(3A) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (3), no court shall take cognizance of any offence, alleged to have been committed by any member of the Forces charged with the maintenance of public order in a State while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty during the period while a Proclamation issued under clause (1) of article 356 of the Constitution was in force therein, except with the previous sanction of the Central Government.

(3B) Notwithstanding anything to the Contrary contained in this Code or any other law, it is hereby declared that any sanction accorded by the State Government or any cognizance taken by a court upon such sanction, during the period commencing on the 20th day of August, 1991 and ending with the date immediately preceding the date on which the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act,

10. Section 19 of the PC Act runs as under :-

""19. Previous sanction necessary for prosecution.
--(1) No court shall take cognizance of an offence punishable under sections 7, 10, 11, 13 and 15 alleged to have been committed by a public servant, except with the previous sanction 1 [save as otherwise provided in the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013 (1 of 2014)]--

(2) Where for any reason whatsoever any doubt arises as to whether the previous sanction as required under sub-section (1) should be given by the Central Government or the State Government or any other authority, such sanction shall be given by that Government or authority which would have been competent to remove the public servant from his office at the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed.
(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974),--
(a) no finding, sentence or order passed by a special Judge shall be reversed or altered by a Court in appeal, confirmation or revision on the ground of the absence of, or any error, omission or irregularity in, the sanction required under sub-section (1), unless in the opinion of that court, a failure of justice has in fact been occasioned thereby;

Explanation.--For the purposes of this section,--
(a) error includes competency of the authority to grant sanction;
(b) a sanction required for prosecution includes reference to any requirement that the prosecution shall be at the instance of a specified authority or with the sanction of a specified person or any requirement of a similar nature.""
11. The impugned orders are mainly attacked on the point of prior sanction under Section 197 of CrPC. It is submitted that the prosecution did not procure a sanction for prosecuting the petitioners, who are retired government servants, as warranted by Section 197 CrPC as well as Section 19 of PC Act.
12. So far as the merits of the case are concerned, suffice it to say that the trial court has considered in detail, the entire factual matrix available on record and the material collected by the investigating agency in support of the charge-sheet and recorded sound and substantial reasons concluding that sufficient evidence is available to put the accused up for trial. Apart that, in the present case charges were framed on 10.01.2018. As the cognizance has been taken by the trial Court and charge sheet has already been filed, therefore, prior sanction which is indirectly a shield provided to the government servants to protect them for an act done in discharge of their official duties, will not be a ground for discharging the petitioners/accused. Similarly, the provisions which are procedural will not hamper the prosecution case on the ground of its retrospective or prospective effect. The above view finds support from the below mentioned judgments.

                             -( 9 )-       MCRC No. 1257/2020
                                          MCRC No. 2844/2020



13. In State of Punjab vs. Labh Singh, reported in 2015 (1) RLW 234 (SC), Hon'ble Apex Court in para No.7 of the judgment, has observed as below:

""In the present case the public servants in question had retired on 13.12.1999 and 30.04.2000. The sanction to prosecute them was rejected subsequent to their retirement i.e. first on 13.09.2000 and later on 24.09.2003. The public servants having retired from service there was no occasion to consider grant of sanction under Sec. 19 of the POC Act. The law on the point is quite clear that sanction to prosecute the public servant for the offences under the POC Act is not required if the public servant had already retired on the date of cognizance by the court. In S.A. Venkataraman vs. State [1958 SCR 1040] while construing section 6(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 which provision is in pari materia with section 19(1) of the POC Act, This Court held that no sanction was necessary in the case of a person who had ceased to be the public servant at the time the court was asked to take cognizance. The view taken in S. A. Venkataraman (supra) was adopted by this court in C.R. Bansi vs. State of Maharashtra [(1970) 3 SCC 537] and in Kalicharan Mahapatra vs. State of Orissa [(1998) 6 SCC 411] and by the Constitution Bench of this court in K. Veeraswamy vs. Union of India. The High Court was not therefore justified in setting aside the order passed by the Special Judge insofar as charge under the POC Act was concerned.""
14. Manifestly thus, the law is well settled that no sanction is required to prosecute a public servant who has ceased to hold office when prosecution is for the offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act.

15. In R. Balakrishna Pillai vs. State of Kerala and another, [AIR 1996 SC 901], it was clearly held that the charge under the Prevention of Corruption Act would not be disturbed

-( 10 )- MCRC No. 1257/2020 MCRC No. 2844/2020 even if the sanction was not taken because the public servant concerned had retired by the date of taking of cognizance.

16. In view of the above discussion, finding no shortcoming, either factual or legal, in the impugned orders dated 13.03.201 and 14.11.2019 passed by the Special Judge under Prevention of Corruption Act, Gwalior in Case No. 03/2020 SST, we are of the view that both these petitions have no merit and are dismissed as such. The trial court shall expedite the trial.

Let a copy of this order be sent to the concerning trial Court for information and compliance.

". The requirements of justice give an occasion for the development of new dimension of justice by evolving juristic principles for doing complete justice according to the current needs of the Society. The quest for justice in the process of administration of justice occasions the evolution of new dimensions of the justice. J.S. Verma, J., in his Article ""New Dimensions of Justice"", (1997) 3 SCC J-3 observed that:-

""...Justice is the ideal to be achieved by Law. Justice is the goal of law. Law is a set of general rules applied in the administration of justice. Justice is in a cause on application of law to a particular case. Jurisprudence is the philosophy of law. Jurisprudence and Law have ultimately to be tested on the anvil of administration of justice. 'Law as it is', may fall short of 'Law as it ought to be' for doing complete justice in a cause. The gap between the two may be described as the field covered by Morality. There is no doubt that the development of the law is influenced by morals. The infusion of morality for reshaping the law is influenced by the principles of Equity and Natural Justice, as effective agencies of growth. The ideal State is when the rules of law satisfy the requirements of justice and the gap between the two is bridged. It is this attempt to bridge the gap which occasions the development of New Jurisprudence.
The existence of some gap between law and justice is recognized by the existing law itself. This is the reason for the recognition of inherent powers of the court by express provision made in the Code of Civil Procedure and the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Constitution of India by Article 142 expressly confers on the Supreme Court plenary powers for doing complete justice in any cause or matter before it. Such power in the court of last resort is recognition of the principle that in the justice delivery system, at the end point attempt must be made to do complete justice in every cause, if that result cannot be achieved by provisions of the enacted law. These powers are in addition to the discretionary powers of courts in certain areas where rigidity is considered inappropriate, e.g., equitable reliefs and Article 226 of the Constitution. ...""
Section 24 of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955

2. Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act empowers the Court to award maintenance pendente lite and litigation expenses to a party who has no independent income sufficient for his/her support in proceedings pending under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, having regard to the income of the parties. The Proviso to Section 24 provides that application under Section 24 shall be disposed of within 60 days of the date of service of notice on the opposite party.

3. Maintenance is not merely a legal right. It is part and parcel of basic human right. For weaker sections, it is a problem in the sense that their very survival rest on the maintenance. The object behind the provision is two-fold: firstly, to prevent vagrancy resulting from stained relation between the husband and wife, and secondly, to ensure that the indigent litigating spouse is not handicapped in defending or prosecuting the case due to want of money. On the breakdown of the marriage, it often so happens that the husband pays nothing for the support of his wife and children and the wife has to fall back upon her parents and relatives to fend her immediate needs. Reasonableness too demands extension of such a relief in favour of a needy spouse. Had not the parties drifted away from one another, the spouse from whom support is sought would have in any case supported the other spouse entailing financial burden. Hence, it is but natural to make the husband bear the cost of maintaining his wife pending disposal of any dispute until some permanent relief is provided to her.

4. In Bhuwan Mohan Singh v. Meena & Ors, AIR 2014 SC 2875 the Supreme Court held that any delay in adjudication of maintenance cases by the Family Court is not only against human rights but also against the basic embodiment of dignity of an individual. The object of the provisions for grant of maintenance is to provide speedy remedy for supply of food, clothing and shelter to the deserted wife and to prevent vagrancy and destitution. The observations of the Supreme Court are as under:

""2. The two issues that pronouncedly emanate in this appeal by special leave are whether the Family Court while deciding an application under Section 7 of the Family Court Act, 1984 (for brevity, ""the Act"") which includes determination of grant of maintenance to the persons as entitled under that provision, should allow adjournments in an extremely liberal manner remaining oblivious of objects and reasons of the Act and also keeping the windows of wisdom closed and the sense of judicial responsiveness suspended to the manifest perceptibility of vagrancy, destitution, impecuniosity, struggle for survival and the emotional fracture, a wife likely to face under these circumstances and further exhibiting absolute insensitivity to her condition, who, after loosing support of the husband who has failed to husband the marital status denies the wife to have maintenance for almost nine years as that much time is consumed to decide the lis and, in addition, to restrict the grant of maintenance to the date of order on some kind of individual notion. Both the approaches, as we perceive, not only defeat the command of the legislature but also frustrate the hope of wife and children who are deprived of adequate livelihood and whose aspirations perish like mushroom and possibly the brief candle of sustenance joins the marathon race of extinction. This delay in adjudication by the Family Court is not only against human rights but also against the basic embodiment of dignity of an individual.
3. Be it ingeminated that Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short ""the Code"") was conceived to ameliorate the agony, anguish, financial suffering of a woman who left her matrimonial home for the reasons provided in the provision so that some suitable arrangements can be made by the Court and she can sustain herself and also her children if they are with her. The concept of sustenance does not necessarily mean to lead the life of an animal, feel like an unperson to be thrown away from grace and roam for her basic maintenance somewhere else. She is entitled in law to lead a life in the similar manner as she would have lived in the house of her husband. That is where the status and strata come into play, and that is where the obligations of the husband, in case of a wife, become a prominent one. In a proceeding of this nature, the husband cannot take subterfuges to deprive her of the benefit of living with dignity. Regard being had to the solemn pledge at the time of marriage and also in consonance with the statutory law that governs the field, it is the obligation of the husband to see that the wife does not become a destitute, a beggar. A situation is not to be maladroitly created whereunder she is compelled to resign to her fate and think of life ""dust unto dust"". It is totally impermissible. In fact, it is the sacrosanct duty to render the financial support even if the husband is required to earn money with physical labour, if he is able bodied. There is no escape route unless there is an order from the Court that the wife is not entitled to get maintenance from the husband on any legally permissible grounds.

9. A three-Judge Bench in Vimla (K.) v. Veeraswamy (K.)[2], while discussing about the basic purpose under Section 125 of the Code, opined that Section 125 of the Code is meant to achieve a social purpose. The object is to prevent vagrancy and destitution. It provides a speedy remedy for the supply of food, clothing and shelter to the deserted wife.
xxx xxx xxx ...It has come to the notice of the Court that on certain occasions the Family Courts have been granting adjournments in a routine manner as a consequence of which both the parties suffer or, on certain occasions, the wife becomes the worst victim. When such a situation occurs, the purpose of the law gets totally atrophied. The Family Judge is expected to be sensitive to the issues, for he is dealing with extremely delicate and sensitive issues pertaining to the marriage and issues ancillary thereto. When we say this, we do not mean that the Family Courts should show undue haste or impatience, but there is a distinction between impatience and to be wisely anxious and conscious about dealing with a situation. A Family Court Judge should remember that the procrastination is the greatest assassin of the lis before it. It not only gives rise to more family problems but also gradually builds unthinkable and Everestine bitterness. It leads to the cold refrigeration of the hidden feelings, if still left. The delineation of the lis by the Family Judge must reveal the awareness and balance. Dilatory tactics by any of the parties has to be sternly dealt with, for the Family Court Judge has to be alive to the fact that the lis before him pertains to emotional fragmentation and delay can feed it to grow. We hope and trust that the Family Court Judges shall remain alert to this and decide the matters as expeditiously as possible keeping in view the objects and reasons of the Act and the scheme of various provisions pertaining to grant of maintenance, divorce, custody of child, property disputes, etc.""
(Emphasis supplied) Basis for the claim of maintenance
5. The basis of the claim for maintenance is that the claimant has no independent income to support herself and the Court has to take into consideration the income of both the parties. It is common knowledge that in maintenance cases parties rarely disclose their true income. The applicant is not generally aware of or is not in possession of documents from which the income of respondent can be ascertained. Such documents are accessible to the respondent only.

6. In Radhika v. Vineet Rungta, 110 (2004) DLT 111, this Court observed that parties rarely disclose their true income and therefore, the Court have to resort to the status and life style of the parties for fixing the maintenance. This Court held as under:

""3. Cases where the parties disclose their actual income are extremely rare. Experience, therefore, dictates that where a decision has to be taken pertaining to the claim for maintenance, and the quantum to be granted, the safer and surer method to be employed for coming to a realistic conclusion is to look at the status of the parties, since whilst incomes can be concealed, the status is palpably evident to all concerned. If any opulent lifestyle is enjoyed by warring spouses he should not be heard to complaint or plead that he has only a meagre income. If this approach had been followed, it would have been evident that the warring spouses enjoy a affluent lifestyle. It has already been noted that the learned Trial Court has not discussed the Husband's income. While granting maintenance it is incumbent on the Court to make such monetary arrangements as would be conducive to the spouses continuing a lifestyle to which they were accustomed before the matrimonial discord.""
(Emphasis supplied)
7. Burden of proving the income 7.1 The true income of the parties is within their personal knowledge and therefore, the onus to prove their true income is on them under Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act.
7.2 Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act reads as under:

""Section 106- Burden of proving fact especially within knowledge -
When any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him.""
7.3 The monthly income of the husband may not very often be within the knowledge of the wife, particularly in a case where the relationship is considerably strained and the spouses are living apart for a considerable period. Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act specifically casts the burden of proof of the income on the husband since the relevant facts relating to his income cannot be within the specific knowledge of the wife.

7.4 It is noticed that upon the failure of the husband to disclose his true income without good reasons, the Courts normally draw a presumption against him and accept the allegations of the wife as to the income of the husband. However, this Court has some reservation about accepting the preposition that whatever estranged wife states with or without rational basis should be accepted as gospel truth. One cannot be oblivious to the human feeling of an estranged wife to exaggerate income of her estranged husband to extract as much as possible due to every increasing lack of sense of security. Every Court is supposed to be circumspect to ensure that unconsciously by any such order the Court is not forcing one or the other party to the extremes. This Court is of the view that the parties should be directed to file a detailed affidavit of their assets, income and expenditure and the supporting documents in order to determine their true income.

7.5 This Court is of the view that the assets, liabilities, income and expenditure of the parties are necessary to be determined not only to fix the maintenance under Section 24 but also to determine the permanent alimony under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act and right to the joint properties under Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act. It is therefore necessary to formulate a format of the affidavit of assets, income and expenditure and also specify the documents to be disclosed by them. The format of the affidavit of assets, income and expenditure would help the Court in determining the true income, expenditure, assets and liabilities of the parties.

8. Section 10 of Family Courts Act, 1984 8.1 The Family Courts Act adopts a less formal procedure. Although Section 10 of the Act makes the procedure laid down under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 applicable to Family Court proceedings, it also lays down that the Family Court is free to evolve its own rules of procedure.

8.2 Section 10(3) of the Family Courts Act specifically uses the word 'truth' and casts a duty on the Family Court to lay down procedure to determine the truth of the facts alleged by one party and denied by the other. Section 10 of the Family Courts Act is reproduced hereunder:

""Section 10 - Procedure generally (1) Subject to the other provisions of this Act and the rules, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) and of any other law for the time being in force shall apply to the suits and proceedings other than proceedings under Chapter IX of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974)], before a Family Court and for the purposes of the said provisions of the Code, a Family Court shall be deemed to be a Civil Court and shall have all the powers of such Court. (2) Subject to the other provisions of this Act and the rules, the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, (2 of 1974), or the rules made thereunder, shall apply to the proceedings under Chapter IX of that Code before a Family Court.
(3) Nothing in sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) shall prevent a Family Court from laying down its own procedure with a view to arrive at a settlement in respect of the subject-matter of the suit or proceedings or at the truth of the facts alleged by the one party and denied by the other.""
9. Truth should be the Guiding Star in the Entire Judicial Process 9.1 It is the duty of the Court to ascertain the true income of the parties and then pass the appropriate order relating to maintenance. Truth is the foundation of justice. Dispensation of justice, based on truth, is an essential feature in the justice delivery system. People would have faith in Courts when truth alone triumphs. The justice based on truth would establish peace in the society.

9.2 Krishna Iyer J. in Jasraj Inder Singh v. Hemraj Multanchand, (1977) 2 SCC 155 described truth and justice as under:

""8. ...Truth, like song, is whole, and half-truth can be noise! Justice is truth, is beauty and the strategy of healing injustice is discovery of the whole truth and harmonising human relations. Law's finest hour is not in meditating on abstractions but in being the delivery agent of full fairness. This divagation is justified by the need to remind ourselves that the grammar of justice according to law is not little litigative solution of isolated problems but resolving the conflict in its wider bearings.""
(Emphasis supplied) 9.3 In Union Carbide Corporation v. Union of India, (1989) 3 SCC 38, the Supreme Court described justice and truth to mean the same. The observations of the Supreme Court are as under:
""30. ...when one speaks of justice and truth, these words mean the same thing to all men whose judgment is uncommitted. Of Truth and Justice, Anatole France said :
""Truth passes within herself a penetrating force unknown alike to error and falsehood. I say truth and you must understand my meaning. For the beautiful words Truth and Justice need not be defined in order to be understood in their true sense. They bear within them a shining beauty and a heavenly light. I firmly believe in the triumph of truth and justice. That is what upholds me in times of trial....""
(Emphasis supplied) 9.4 In Mohanlal Shamji Soni v. Union of India, 1991 Supp (1) SCC 271, the Supreme Court observed that the presiding officer of a Court should not simply sit as a mere umpire at a contest between two parties and declare at the end of the combat who has won and who has lost and that there is a legal duty of his own, independent of the parties, to take an active role in the proceedings in finding the truth and administering justice.
9.5 In Chandra Shashi v. Anil Kumar Verma, (1995) 1 SCC 421, the Supreme Court observed that to enable the Courts to ward off unjustified interference in their working, those who indulge in immoral acts like perjury, pre-variation and motivated falsehoods have to be appropriately dealt with, without which it would not be possible for any Court to administer justice in the true sense and to the satisfaction of those who approach it in the hope that truth would ultimately prevail. People would have faith in Courts when they would find that truth alone triumphs in Courts.

9.6 In Zahira Habibullah Sheikh v. State of Gujarat, (2006) 3 SCC 374, the Supreme Court observed that right from the inception of the judicial system it has been accepted that discovery, vindication and establishment of truth are the main purposes underlying existence of Courts of justice.

9.7 In Himanshu Singh Sabharwal v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (2008) 3 SCC 602, the Supreme Court held that the trial should be a search for the truth and not about over technicalities. The Supreme Court's observation are as under:

""5. ... 31. In 1846, in a judgment which Lord Chancellor Selborne would later describe as 'one of the ablest judgments of one of the ablest judges who ever sat in this Court', Vice-Chancellor Knight Bruce said [Pearse v. Pearse, (1846) 1 De G&Sm. 12 : 16 LJ Ch 153 : 63 ER 950 : 18 Digest (Repl.) 91, 748] : (De G&Sm. pp. 28-29):
""31. The discovery and vindication and establishment of truth are main purposes certainly of the existence of courts of justice; still, for the obtaining of these objects, which, however valuable and important, cannot be usefully pursued without moderation, cannot be either usefully or creditably pursued unfairly or gained by unfair means, not every channel is or ought to be open to them. The practical inefficacy of torture is not, I suppose, the most weighty objection to that mode of examination,... Truth, like all other good things, may be loved unwisely--may be pursued too keenly--may cost too much.
xxx xxx xxx
35. Courts have always been considered to have an overriding duty to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice--often referred to as the duty to vindicate and uphold the 'majesty of the law'.
(Emphasis Supplied) 9.8 In Maria Margarida Sequeria Fernandes v. Erasmo Jack de Sequeria, (2012) 5 SCC 370, the Supreme Court again highlighted the significance of truth and observed that the truth should be the guiding star in the entire legal process and it is the duty of the Judge to discover truth to do complete justice.
The Supreme Court stressed that Judge has to play an active role to discover the truth and he should explore all avenues open to him in order to discover the truth. The Supreme Court observed as under:

""32. In this unfortunate litigation, the Court's serious endeavour has to be to find out where in fact the truth lies.
33. The truth should be the guiding star in the entire judicial process.Truth alone has to be the foundation of justice. The entire judicial system has been created only to discern and find out the real truth. Judges at all levels have to seriously engage themselves in the journey of discovering the truth. That is their mandate, obligation and bounden duty. Justice system will acquire credibility only when people will be convinced that justice is based on the foundation of the truth.
xxx xxx xxx
35. What people expect is that the Court should discharge its obligation to find out where in fact the truth lies. Right from inception of the judicial system it has been accepted that discovery, vindication and establishment of truth are the main purposes underlying the existence of the courts of justice.
xxx xxx xxx
52. Truth is the foundation of justice. It must be the endeavour of all the judicial officers and judges to ascertain truth in every matter and no stone should be left unturned in achieving this object. Courts must give greater emphasis on the veracity of pleadings and documents in order to ascertain the truth.""
(Emphasis supplied)
10. False claims and defences 10.1 In Dalip Singh v. State of U.P., (2010) 2 SCC 114, the Supreme Court observed that a new creed of litigants have cropped up in the last 40 years who do not have any respect for truth and shamelessly resort to falsehood and unethical means for achieving their goals. The observations of the Supreme Court are as under:-
""1. For many centuries, Indian society cherished two basic values of life i.e., 'Satya' (truth) and 'Ahimsa' (non- violence). Mahavir, Gautam Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi guided the people to ingrain these values in their daily life. Truth constituted an integral part of the justice- delivery system which was in vogue in the pre- Independence era and the people used to feel proud to tell truth in the courts irrespective of the consequences. However, post-Independence period has seen drastic changes in our value system. The materialism has over shadowed the old ethos and the quest for personal gain has become so intense that those involved in litigation do not hesitate to take shelter of falsehood, misrepresentation and suppression of facts in the court proceedings.
2. In last 40 years, a new creed of litigants has cropped up. Those who belong to this creed do not have any respect for truth. They shamelessly resort to falsehood and unethical means for achieving their goals. In order to meet the challenge posed by this new creed of litigants, the courts have, from time to time, evolved new rules and it is now well established that a litigant, who attempts to pollute the stream of justice or who touches the pure fountain of justice with tainted hands, is not entitled to any relief, interim or final.""
(Emphasis supplied) 10.2 In Satyender Singh v. Gulab Singh, 2012 (129) DRJ 128, the Division Bench of this Court following Dalip Singh v. State of U.P. (supra) observed that the Courts are flooded with litigation with false and incoherent pleas and tainted evidence led by the parties due to which the judicial system in the country is choked and such litigants are consuming Court's time for a wrong cause.
The observations of this Court are as under:-

""2. As rightly observed by the Supreme Court, Satya is a basic value of life which was required to be followed by everybody and is recognized since many centuries. In spite of caution, courts are continued to be flooded with litigation with false and incoherent pleas and tainted evidence led by the parties. The judicial system in the country is choked and such litigants are consuming courts' time for a wrong cause. Efforts are made by the parties to steal a march over their rivals by resorting to false and incoherent statements made before the Court. Indeed, it is a nightmare faced by a Trier of Facts; required to stitch a garment, when confronted with a fabric where the weft, shuttling back and forth across the warp in weaving, is nothing but lies. As the threads of the weft fall, the yarn of the warp also collapses; and there is no fabric left.""
(Emphasis supplied)
11. Imposition of costs 11.1 In Ramrameshwari Devi v. Nirmala Devi, (2011) 8 SCC 249, the Supreme Court has held that the Courts have to take into consideration pragmatic realities and have to be realistic in imposing the costs. The relevant paragraphs of the said judgment are reproduced hereunder:-
""43. ...We are clearly of the view that unless we ensure that wrongdoers are denied profit or undue benefit from the frivolous litigation, it would be difficult to control frivolous and uncalled for litigations. In order to curb uncalled for and frivolous litigation, the courts have to ensure that there is no incentive or motive for uncalled for litigation. It is a matter of common experience that court's otherwise scarce and valuable time is consumed or more appropriately wasted in a large number of uncalled for cases.
xxx xxx xxx
52. The main question which arises for our consideration is whether the prevailing delay in civil litigation can be curbed? In our considered opinion the existing system can be drastically changed or improved if the following steps are taken by the trial courts while dealing with the civil trials.
xxx xxx xxx C. Imposition of actual, realistic or proper costs and or ordering prosecution would go a long way in controlling the tendency of introducing false pleadings and forged and fabricated documents by the litigants. Imposition of heavy costs would also control unnecessary adjournments by the parties. In appropriate cases the courts may consider ordering prosecution otherwise it may not be possible to maintain purity and sanctity of judicial proceedings...
xxx xxx xxx
54. While imposing costs we have to take into consideration pragmatic realities and be realistic what the Defendants or the Respondents had to actually incur in contesting the litigation before different courts. We have to also broadly take into consideration the prevalent fee structure of the lawyers and other miscellaneous expenses which have to be incurred towards drafting and filing of the counter affidavit, miscellaneous charges towards typing, photocopying, court fee etc.
55. The other factor which should not be forgotten while imposing costs is for how long the Defendants or Respondents were compelled to contest and defend the litigation in various courts. The Appellants in the instant case have harassed the Respondents to the hilt for four decades in a totally frivolous and dishonest litigation in various courts. The Appellants have also wasted judicial time of the various courts for the last 40 years.
56. On consideration of totality of the facts and circumstances of this case, we do not find any infirmity in the well reasoned impugned order/judgment. These appeals are consequently dismissed with costs, which we quantify as Rs. 2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakhs only). We are imposing the costs not out of anguish but by following the fundamental principle that wrongdoers should not get benefit out of frivolous litigation....""
(Emphasis supplied) 11.2 In Maria Margarida Sequeria Fernandes v. Erasmo Jack de Sequeria (supra) the Supreme Court held that heavy costs and prosecution should be ordered in cases of false claims and defences. The Supreme Court held as under:-
""82. This Court in a recent judgment in Ramrameshwari Devi and Ors. (supra) aptly observed at page 266, para 43 that unless wrongdoers are denied profit from frivolous litigation, it would be difficult to prevent it. In order to curb uncalled for and frivolous litigation, the Courts have to ensure that there is no incentive or motive for uncalled for litigation. It is a matter of common experience that Court's otherwise scarce time is consumed or more appropriately, wasted in a large number of uncalled for cases. In this very judgment, the Court provided that this problem can be solved or at least be minimized if exemplary cost is imposed for instituting frivolous litigation. The Court observed at pages 267-268 that imposition of actual, realistic or proper costs and/or ordering prosecution in appropriate cases would go a long way in controlling the tendency of introducing false pleadings and forged and fabricated documents by the litigants. Imposition of heavy costs would also control unnecessary adjournments by the parties. In appropriate cases, the Courts may consider ordering prosecution otherwise it may not be possible to maintain purity and sanctity of judicial proceedings.""
12. Judge's Power to put questions or order production 12.1 Section 165 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 invests the Judge with plenary powers to put any question to any witness or party; in any form, at any time, about any fact relevant or irrelevant. Section 165 is intended to arm the Judge with the most extensive power possible for the purpose of getting at the truth.
The effect of this section is that in order to get to the bottom of the matter before it, the Court will be able to look at and inquire into every fact and thus possibly acquire valuable indicative evidence which may lead to other evidence strictly relevant and admissible. The Court is not, however, permitted to found its judgment on any but relevant statements.

12.2 Section 165 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 reads as under:

""Section 165. Judge's power to put questions or order production.-
The Judge may, in order to discover or obtain proper proof of relevant facts, ask any question he pleases, in any form, at any time, of any witness, or of the parties, about any fact relevant or irrelevant; and may order the production of any document or thing; and neither the parties nor their agents shall be entitled to make any objection to any such question or order, nor, without the leave of the Court, to cross-examine any witness upon any answer given in reply to any such question: Provided that the judgment must be based upon facts declared by this Act to be relevant, and duly proved: Provided also that this section shall not authorize any Judge to compel any witness to answer any question or to produce any document which such witness would be entitled to refuse to answer or produce under Sections 121 to 131, both inclusive, if the question were asked or the document were called for by the adverse party; nor shall the Judge ask any question which it would be improper for any other person to ask under Section 148 or 149 ; nor shall he dispense with primary evidence of any document, except in the cases herein before excepted.""
12.3 The object of a trial is, first to ascertain truth by the light of reason, and then, do justice upon the basis of the truth and the Judge is not only justified but required to elicit a fact, wherever the interest of truth and justice would suffer, if he did not.

12.4 The Judge contemplated by Section 165 is not a mere umpire at a wit-combat between the lawyers for the parties whose only duty is to enforce the rules of the game and declare at the end of the combat who has won and who has lost. He is expected, and indeed it is his duty, to explore all avenues open to him in order to discover the truth and to that end, question witnesses on points which the lawyers for the parties have either overlooked or left obscure or willfully avoided. A Judge, who at the trial merely sits and records evidence without caring so to conduct the examination of the witnesses that every point is brought out, is not fulfilling his duty.

12.5 The Supreme Court in Ram Chander v. State of Haryana, (1981) 3 SCC 191 observed that under Section 165, the Court has ample power and discretion to control the trial effectively. While conducting trial, the Court is not required to sit as a silent spectator or umpire but to take active part within the boundaries of law by putting questions to witnesses in order to elicit the truth and to protect the weak and the innocent. It is the duty of a Judge to discover the truth and for that purpose he may ""ask any question, in any form, at any time, of any witness, or of the parties, about any fact, relevant or irrelevant"".

12.6 In Ritesh Tewari v. State of Uttar Pradesh, (2010) 10 SCC 677, the Supreme Court held that every trial is a voyage of discovery in which truth is the quest. The power under Section 165 is to be exercised with the object of subserving the cause of justice and public interest, and for getting the evidence in aid of a just decision and to uphold the truth. It is an extraordinary power conferred upon the Court to elicit the truth and to act in the interest of justice. The purpose being to secure justice by full discovery of truth and an accurate knowledge of facts, the Court can put questions to the parties, except those which fall within exceptions contained in the said provision itself.

12.7 In State of Rajasthan v. Ani, (1997) 6 SCC162, the Supreme Court held that Section 165 of the Indian Evidence Act confers vast and unrestricted powers on the Court to elicit truth. Reticence may be good in many circumstances, but a Judge remaining mute during trial is not an ideal situation. A taciturn Judge may be the model caricatured in public mind. But there is nothing wrong in his becoming active or dynamic during trial so that criminal justice being the end could be achieved. A Judge is expected to actively participate in the trial to elicit necessary materials from witnesses in the appropriate context which he feels necessary for reaching the correct conclusion.

Suggestions

13. Vide order dated 18th September, 2014, this Court had suggested that all petitions under Sections 9 to 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act to be accompanied with an affidavit of assets, income and expenditure of the petitioner in terms of Puneet Kaur v. Inderjeet Sawhney (supra) and the respondent should file his/her affidavit of assets, income and expenditure within 30 days of the service of the notice along with the response of the petitioner's affidavit (paras 33.3 and 33.5 of the order dated 18th September, 2014).

15. Affidavit of income and assets provided in Form 16A of APPENDIX-E under Order 21 Rule 41(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure 15.1 Order 21 Rule 41(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure empowers the Court, in execution of a money decree, to examine the judgment debtor to ascertain the properties owned by him. Order 21 Rule 41(2) further empowers the Court to direct the judgment debtor to file an affidavit stating the particulars of the assets of the judgment debtor. Upon disobedience of such an order, Order 21 Rule 41(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure empowers the Court to send the judgment debtor to civil prison for a term not exceeding three months.

15.2 The form of the affidavit required to be filed by the judgment debtor under Order 21 Rule 41(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure is provided in Form 16-A in Appendix E.

15.3 Initially the Matrimonial Courts were directing the parties to file the affidavit in the format given in Form 16-A of Appendix E under Order 21 Rule 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure but the litigants were not truly disclosing their income in the said affidavit.

15.4 This Court is of the view that the format of affidavit of assets, income and expenditure provided in Form 16-A of Appendix E of the Code of Civil Procedure is not comprehensive to discover the complete income, assets and expenditure of the parties in matrimonial litigation and therefore, there is a need to formulate a comprehensive affidavit of assets, income and expenditure.

"1. Vide this judgment I shall dispose of the complaint filed by the complainant under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act ').

2. Brief facts relevant for the decision of the case are as under:-

Itt is contended by the complainant that the accused has been known to him for last several years and on account of that acquaintance, the accused approached him for grant of financial assistance/loan and promised to repay the said amount and interest towards repayment of the said loan amount. In discharge of liability, the accused issued three cheques bearing no. 266487 dated 27.01.2009 for a sum of Rs. 50,000/-, bearing no. 266488 dated 28.01.2009 for a sum of Rs. 50,000/- & bearing no. 266489 dated 25.01.2009 for a sum of Rs. 50,000/- drawn on Punjab National Bank, Rohini, Delhi to the complainant. When the aforesaid cheques were presented for encashment, the same were returned dishonoured with the remarks ""funds insufficient"" vide cheques return memos dated 03.02.2009. After dishonour of the aforesaid cheques, complainant issued a legal notice dated 18.02.2009 to the accused through registered A.D. and UPC post. Despite that the accused neither replied to the legal notice nor made any payment of cheques amount. Thereafter, complainant has filed the present complaint case with the submission that accused be summoned, tried and punished according to law.

3. In his pre-summoning evidence, complainant examined himself on affidavit. He reiterated the contents of complaint and placed on record, three cheques bearing no. 266487 dated 27.01.2009 for a sum of Rs. 50,000/-, bearing no. 266488 dated 28.01.2009 for a sum of Rs. 50,000/- & bearing no. 266489 dated 25.01.2009 for a sum of Rs. 50,000/- drawn on Punjab National Bank, Rohini, Delhi as Ex. CW-1/1, Ex. CW-1/2 & Ex. CW-1/3 respectively, respectively cheques returning memos dated 03.02.2009 as Ex. CW-1/4 & Ex. CW-1/5, legal notice dated 18.02.2009 as Ex. CW-1/6, postal receipt as Ex. CW-1/7 and UPC receipt as Ex. CW-1/8.

4. Upon appreciation of pre-summoning evidence, accused was summoned for an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Act and notice under Section 251 Cr.P.C. for this offence was framed upon accused on 01.03.2013 to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. He took the defence that there was a property deal between him and the complainant and as a token three blank signed cheques were issued to the complainant around twelve years ago and the complainant assured him that if the deal could not be Hari Chand Batra v. Ashok Saxena/Kanojia CC No. 529664/2016 Page no. 2 materialized, the aforesaid cheques would be returned back. He stated that the deal was not materialized and the complainant misused his cheques. He denied having any liability towards the complainant. He further denied receiving of legal notice regarding the cheques in question.

5. Thereafter, the complainant examined only himself in post notice evidence. He adopted his pre-summoning evidence towards examination in chief. During cross- examination, the complainant stated that he came to know the accused through a person namely Sh. Deepak Kharbanda around 8-10 years back. The complainant also stated that the complainant used to deal in the property business with Sh. Deepak Kharbanda but only rarely. The complainant stated that he met the accused when the accused used to sit in one of the nearby offices of the other property dealers namely Suri Property in the locality of the complainant as he also used to visit those offices. It was further stated by the complainant that he used to run a property dealing business in the name of Batra Associates for the period 2003 to 2009 with a gap from 2004-2006 when the complainant discontinued the business due to his bypass surgery. According to the complainant, the accused had approached him for taking loan several times, however, when the accused approached him again for a loan in the month of July 2008, the complainant advanced loan to him for 2-3 months. The complainant further mentioned that no written agreement was executed between him and the accused. Further the cheques in question were given by the accused to the complainant in October 2008 and the accused filled in name of payee, amount, and date in the cheque. He denied the suggestion that the cheques in question were given by the accused 12 years ago for the business purpose of property dealing and the same had not been returned by him on excuse of him misplacing those cheques due to change in his residence from Rohtak to Sector-15, Rohini. The complainant further stated that he did not remember whether the cheques in question bore a four digit or 16 digit account number of the accused.

6. On 09.10.2014, statement of accused under Section 281 Cr.P.C. read with Section 313 Cr.P.C. was recorded in which all the incriminating evidence was put to him to which accused took the defence that he never took any loan from the complainant. He stated that the cheques in question were given by him to the complainant regarding some Hari Chand Batra v. Ashok Saxena/Kanojia CC No. 529664/2016 Page no. 3 property transaction. He admitted his signatures on cheques in question. He denied having filled in name of payee, date, and other contents in the cheques in question. He stated that as the transaction regarding the property could not be fructified, he does not have any liability towards the complainant. He stated that the complainant promised him to return the cheques in question whenever he would find the same. He further stated that the complainant has misused the cheques in question by filing the present case against him. The accused preferred to lead defence evidence.

7. In defence evidence, the accused examined himself and one witness namely Sh.Vinod Khurana, Officer, Punjab National Bank.

The accused as DW-1 in his examination in chief stated that he came in contact with the complainant through a person namely Sh. Deepak Kharbanda who was doing business of property dealing with the complainant. The accused stated that the complainant developed good relations with him and they started doing business of property dealing together. According to the accused, the cheques in question were given to the complainant around 14-15 years back with only the columns of signature and amount filled by the accused during a property dealing transaction for finalizing a deal.

During cross-examination, the accused stated that the cheques were given in the presence of Sh. Deepak Kharbanda in the office of the complainant and when the deal did not finalize the accused asked the complainant to return the cheques several times. However, the same were not returned and the complainant stated that he had misplaced those cheques due to shifting of his house. The accused submitted that he did not file any complaint against the complainant for not returning those cheques as he trusted the complainant and believed his reason. Further he also did not give any direction to his banker to stop the payment regarding the cheques in question. The accused further stated that he stopped doing the business with the complainant after that and it was only when he was arrested by the police that the present matter came to his knowledge. He then realized that the cheques have been misused by the complainant. The accused further stated that the cheques in question were not given by him in October 2008 but rather 14- 15 years ago which is evident with the mention of his four digit account number in the cheques as the bank used to maintain four digit account number of the account holders 14-15 years ago as opposed to 16 digit account number being maintained as today.

8. Sh. Vinod Khurana, Officer, Punjab National Bank as DW-2 was examined and discharged without cross-examination despite given opportunity. He stated in examination Hari Chand Batra v. Ashok Saxena/Kanojia CC No. 529664/2016 Page no. 4 in chief that as per bank record the cheque book no. 266481(SCD) to 266500 was issued on 09.08.2000 in the name of Sh. Ashok Saxena, account no. 1379 and the said cheque book issuance record was Ex. DW-2/1. He stated that the cheques in question Ex. CW-1/1 to Ex. CW-1/ 3 are pertaining to the said cheque book issued on 09.08.2000. He stated that the account maintained by Ashok Saxena was previously in four digit account number i.e. 1379 and the same was converted into 16 digit account number i.e. 3028000100013790 on 29.05.2005 the said account converting report was Ex. DW-2/2. He stated that the account number mentioned as 1379 on the cheques in question was filled up by the bank. He further stated that later on when the cheque is being presented for encashment then on enquiry 16 digit account number was provided to the customer presenting the cheque who would then mention the said 16 digit number on the cheque himself.

9. Thereafter, despite there being another witness namely Sh. Deepak Kharbanda mentioned in the list of witness provided by the accused, the accused closed the defence evidence. On 25.07.2016, he moved an application under Section 311 of Cr.P.C. which was allowed by the court vide order dated 18.11.2016. Accordingly, Sh. Deepak Kharbanda as DW-3 was examined, cross-examined and discharged. He stated in his examination in chief that the complainant and him were in the business of property dealing. He further stated that both the complainant and the accused were his friends and used to visit his office. According to him, the complainant and the accused met each other at his office, became friends and started the business of property dealing together from the office of the complainant. He further submitted that one day the accused called him and told him that the complainant was not returning his cheques to which he responded that the complainant would return back the cheques. The witness also stated that during that time the complainant shifted his house to Rohini. It was further submitted that the accused approached the witness and informed him that the complainant had misused his cheques and implicated him in a false case therefore, the witness had appeared before the court to inform the court about the reality of the facts. According to the witness, the complainant used to take cheques from the accused and the complainant used to give cheques as bayana to their clients and after selling the property, the accused and the complainant used to divide the profit of the transaction between them.

During cross-examination, he stated that he dealt with the business of property dealership in partnership with the complainant. However, he has no documentary proof regarding the same. The witness stated that the cheques were handed over by the Hari Chand Batra v. Ashok Saxena/Kanojia CC No. 529664/2016 Page no. 5 accused in his presence, however, he did not have any documentary proof of the same. He further stated that in his knowledge there is no liability of the accused towards the complainant and that there was a dealing of a Janta flat where the complainant and the accused were the purchasers. However, there was no sale deed executed and registered between seller and the purchaser. There was a bayana receipt, however, the witness is unable to produce bayana receipt. He denied the suggestion that he was asked by the accused to make a false statement in the court.

10. Thereafter, final arguments were addressed on behalf of both the parties. It was submitted by Ld. Counsel for the complainant during final arguments that loan of Rs.1,50,000/- was taken by the accused from the complainant. It was contended by Ld. Counsel for the complainant that three cheques were given by the accused in discharge of his liability and the same got dishonoured on presentation. It was further submitted that legal notice regarding the same was given, however, despite that no payment was made by the accused. It was contended that loan amount and signatures on the cheques in question has already been accepted by the accused. It was contended that complainant has fulfilled all the ingredients of offence under Section 138 of the Act and presumption of law lies in favour of the complainant. The complainant relied upon judgments:C.C. Alavi Haji v. Palapaetty Muhammed & Anr. [(2007) 6 SCC 555], Prakash Jewellers v. A.K. Jewellers [2002 (99) DLT 244], Rangappa v. Sri Mohan [(2010) 11 SCC 441], Johnson Scaria v. State of Kerala [II (2007) BC 450], P.V. Constructions v. K.J. Augusty [2007 CriLJ 154], Ajit v. Smt. Kriti & Anr. [I (2005) BC 315], Mulammoottil Consumer Crdit v. Sreenivassan [2006 (4) KLT 543], Francis v. Pradeep [2004 CriLJ 3827], Ramakrishnan v. Parthasaradhy [III (2003) BC 241], A.R.M. Nizmathuallah v. Vaduganathan [2008 CriLJ 880], K.N. Kittusamy v. A.P. Shubhramaniam & Anr. [Crl. A. No. 399 of 2015], V.R. Shresti v. Bhaskar P. [Criminal Appeal No. 2109 of 2017], Suresh Kumar Joon v. Mool Chand Motors & Ors. [CS (OS) 389/2009] &A.V. Murthy v. B.S. Nagabasavanna [(2002) 2 SCC 642]. Same are perused and taken into consideration.

Per contra, it was submitted by Ld. Counsel for the accused during final arguments that the accused never took any loan from the complainant and the cheques were issued for the purpose of a property deal which never materialized. It was contended that there is no specific mention in the complaint as well as evidence by affidavit as to when the accused approached the complainant for the loan and for what amount. It was further submitted that the complainant did not return the cheques despite the accused asking for the same several times and misused them by filing this false case. The accused asserted Hari Chand Batra v. Ashok Saxena/Kanojia CC No. 529664/2016 Page no. 6 that the present case is a false one as the cheques were given in the year 2000 and presented in year 2009 which is why the cheques carried four digit account number and not sixteen digits. The accused also contended that he never received the legal notice with regard to the present case and that there is no proof of service of legal notice to the accused on record thereby pushing the present case outside the scope of offence under Section 138 of the Act as pre-requisite of section 138 (b) of the Act has not been fulfilled.

11. I have considered the rival submissions of the parties and perused the entire evidence led by the complainant as well as by the accused.

12. Before appreciating the facts of the case in detail for the purpose of decision, let relevant position of law be discussed first:-

For the offence under Section 138 of the Act to be made out against the accused, the complainant must prove the following points, that:-

1. the accused issued a cheque on account maintained by him with a bank.
2. the said cheque has been issued in discharge, in whole or in part, of any legal debt or other liability.
3. the said cheque has been presented to the bank within a period of three months from the date of cheque or within the period of its validity.
4. the aforesaid cheque, when presented for encashment, was returned unpaid/dishonoured.
5. the payee of the cheque issued a legal notice of demand to the drawer within 30 days from the receipt of information by him from the bank regarding the return of the cheque.
6. the drawer of the cheque failed to make the payment within 15 days of the receipt of aforesaid legal notice of demand.
13. The Act raises two presumptions in favour of the holder of the cheque i.e. complainant in the present case; firstly, in regard to the passing of consideration as contained in Section 118 (a) and secondly, a presumption that the holder of cheque receiving the same of the nature referred to in Section 139 discharged in whole or in part any debt or other liability.

Section 118 of the N.I Act provides : ""Presumptions as to negotiable instruments: Until the contrary is proved, the following presumptions shall be made: (a) of consideration

- that every negotiable instrument was made or drawn for consideration, and that every Hari Chand Batra v. Ashok Saxena/Kanojia CC No. 529664/2016 Page no. 7 such instrument, when it has been accepted, indorsed, negotiated or transferred was accepted, indorsed, negotiated or transferred for consideration;""

Section 139 of the N.I Act further provides as follows: ""Presumption in favour of holder - it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that the holder of a cheque received the cheque of the nature referred to in Section 138 for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability"".

14. I have perused the entire record and have given due considerations to the submissions made by the respective counsels of the parties. The court has to first see as to whether the complainant has proved that the accused issued the cheques in question towards a legal liability or not from the account maintained by him. In this regard, complainant has relied upon his affidavit Ex. CW-1/A. Further, accused throughout trial admitted his signatures on cheques Ex. CW-1/1 to Ex. CW-1/3 which by itself is sufficient proof of issuance of cheques towards a legal liability. In this regard, presumption under Section 139 of the Act is raised in favour of the complainant. In the present case, the accused has admitted in the notice under Section 251 Cr.P.C. that the cheques in question bear his signatures and he issued the same in favour of the complainant. Reference can be made to Judgment of Apex Court in Rangappa (supra) that, ""Once the cheque relates to the account of the accused and he accepts and admits the signatures on the said cheque, then initial presumption as contemplated under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act has to be raised by the Court in favour of the complainant."" Defence taken by the accused is that he came to know the complainant through a person namely Sh. Deepak Kharbanda and they became good friends. The accused then used to do business of property dealing with the complainant where he used to give blank cheques by filing the amount and signature in order to finalize the property dealings. The accused in his examination in chief stated that the cheques in question were given to the complainant around 14-15 years ago with only the amount filled by him for the finalization of a property deal that the complainant and him were doing together and not in October 2008 as contended by the complainant. The accused examined one bank witness who brought the record viz. cheque book issuance record Ex. DW-2/1 regarding cheque book no. 266481(SCD) to 266500 which was issued on 09.08.2000 in the name of Sh.Ashok Saxena, account no. 1379 and the account converting report Ex. DW-2/2 with details regarding account being converted into 16 digit account number i.e. 3028000100013790 on 29.05.2005. The accused also stated that the cheques were given in the presence of Hari Chand Batra v. Ashok Saxena/Kanojia CC No. 529664/2016 Page no. 8 Sh.Deepak Kharbanda in the office of the complainant. For this, the accused examined Sh.Deepak Kharbanda as DW-3 who supported the version of the accused and stated that he used to do the business of property dealing with the complainant together. The accused contended that the deal for which the cheques in question were issued did not materialize and despite him asking the complainant to return his cheques several times, the complainant never returned the same and informed the accused that the cheques in question were misplaced by the complainant due to shifting of his house. The accused further took the stand that the complainant misused these cheques in question and he came to know the present case only when the police arrested him. The accused stated that he did not receive the legal notice and there was no proof on behalf of the complainant regarding the service of the legal notice. During cross-examination, the accused contended that he had written the amount in words and figures and signed the cheques on his own before giving it to the complainant for the property deal. The accused further stated that he did not make any complaint against the complainant about returning the cheques because he trusted the complainant. The accused also stated that he did not give any direction to his bank to stop the payment regarding the cheques in question even after coming to know about the misplacement of the same.

15. For the offence under Section 138 of the Act, the presumptions under Sections 118(a) and 139 have to be compulsory raised as soon as execution of cheque by accused is admitted or proved by the complainant and thereafter burden is shifted to accused to prove otherwise. These presumptions shall end only when the contrary is proved by the accused, that is, the cheque was not issued for consideration and in discharge of any debt or liability etc. A presumption is not in itself evidence but only makes a prima facie case for a party for whose benefit it exists. Presumptions both under Sections 118 and 139 are rebuttable in nature. Same was held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Hiten P. Dalal v. Bratindranath Banerjee [(2001) 6 SCC 16].

16. This Court in Bharat Barrel & Drum Manufacturing Company v. Amin Chand Pyarelal, (1999) 3 SCC 35 had occasion to consider Section 118(a) of the Act. This Court held that once execution of the promissory note is admitted, the presumption under Section 118(a) would arise that the execution is supported by a consideration. Such a presumption is rebuttable and defendant can prove the non-existence of a consideration by raising a probable defence. In paragraph No.12 following has been laid down:-

""12. Upon consideration of various judgments as noted hereinabove, the Hari Chand Batra v. Ashok Saxena/Kanojia CC No. 529664/2016 Page no. 9 position of law which emerges is that once execution of the promissory note is admitted, the presumption under Section 118(a) would arise that it is supported by a consideration. Such a presumption is rebuttable. The defendant can prove the non-existence of a consideration by raising a probable defence. If the defendant is proved to have discharged the initial onus of proof showing that the existence of consideration was improbable or doubtful or the same was illegal, the onus would shift to the plaintiff who will be obliged to prove it as a matter of fact and upon its failure to prove would disentitle him to the grant of relief on the basis of the negotiable instrument. The burden upon the defendant of proving the non-existence of the consideration can be either direct or by bringing on record the preponderance of probabilities by reference to the circumstances upon which he relies. In such an event, the plaintiff is entitled under law to rely upon all the evidence led in the case including that of the plaintiff as well. In case, where the defendant fails to discharge the initial onus of proof by showing the non-existence of the consideration, the plaintiff would invariably be held entitled to the benefit of presumption arising under Section 118(a) in his favour. The court may not insist upon the defendant to disprove the existence of consideration by leading direct evidence as the existence of negative evidence is neither possible nor contemplated and even if led, is to be seen with a doubt. The bare denial of the passing of the consideration apparently does not appear to be any defence. Something which is probable has to be brought on record for getting the benefit of shifting the onus of proving to the plaintiff. To disprove the presumption, the defendant has to bring on record such facts and circumstances upon consideration of which the court may either believe that the consideration did not exist or its nonexistence was so probable that a prudent man would, under the circumstances of the case, shall act upon the plea that it did not exist.""

17. In Kumar Exports v. Sharma Carpets [(2009) 2 SCC 513] this Court examined as to when complainant discharges the burden to prove that instrument was executed and when the burden shall be shifted. In paragraph No. 20, following has been laid down:-

""20. The accused may adduce direct evidence to prove that the note in question was not supported by consideration and that there was no debt or liability to be discharged by him. However, the court need not insist in every case that the accused should disprove the non-existence of consideration and debt by leading direct evidence because the existence of negative evidence is neither possible nor contemplated.
Hari Chand Batra v. Ashok Saxena/Kanojia CC No. 529664/2016 Page no. 10 At the same time, it is clear that bare denial of the passing of the consideration and existence of debt, apparently would not serve the purpose of the accused. Something which is probable has to be brought on record for getting the burden of proof shifted to the complainant. To disprove the presumptions, the accused should bring on record such facts and circumstances, upon consideration of which, the court may either believe that the consideration and debt did not exist or their non-existence was so probable that a prudent man would under the circumstances of the case, act upon the plea that they did not exist.""

18. In other judgment reported as Rohitbhai Jivanlal Patel v. State of Gujarat and Another this Court held as under:

""20. On the aspects relating to preponderance of probabilities, the accused has to bring on record such facts and such circumstances which may lead the Court to conclude either that the consideration did not exist or that its nonexistence was so probable that a prudent man would, under the circumstances of the case, act upon the plea that the consideration did not exist. This Court has, time and again, emphasized that though there may not be sufficient negative evidence which could be brought on record by the accused to discharge his burden, yet mere denial would not fulfill the requirements of rebuttal as 8 AIR 2019 SC 1876 envisaged under Section 118 and 139 of the NI Act.""
19. It is now well settled as evident by plethora of judgments that the presumption raised under Sections 118(a) & 139 of the Act is a rebuttable presumption and the accused need not come into the witness box or produce a strong proof to rebut the presumption as the rebuttal can be achieved through preponderance of probabilities unlike the complainant. However, a mere submission that the case presented by the complainant is false and that the cheques of the accused have been misused by the complainant is not enough without any evidence of the rebuttal presented on record. Mere denial without any corroborative evidence would not deprive the complainant of the benefit bestowed on him under the special provisions of this Act. In the present case, it is submitted by the accused that the cheques were given to the complainant in the year 2000 and not in year 2008, however, there has been no evidence produce on record to prove the same. The evidence presented on record by the accused in this regard in the form of Ex.DW-2/1 and Ex. DW- 2/2 merely proves that the cheques in question were issued from a cheque book issued to the accused back in year 2000 by the bank. Neither Ex. DW-2/1 nor Ex. DW-2/2 assists the accused in proving that the cheques were issued in year 2000 and not in the year Hari Chand Batra v. Ashok Saxena/Kanojia CC No. 529664/2016 Page no. 11 2008. Issuance of a cheque book at a certain time has no bearing on when the cheques are issued out of that book. The accused further did not place any evidence to show any steps taken by him to recover the given cheques from the complainant either in the form of any written communication or in the form of any complaint filed against the same for a period of 14-15 years. It is also accepted by the accused that he never gave the directions to the banker to stop the payment with regard to the cheques in question after getting to know that the same have been misplaced by the complainant which this court fails to understand as the same is expected from any prudent man. Further, the contention of the accused that the complainant did not mention anywhere in the complaint and affidavit the date and time as to when the accused approached the complainant for taking loan and as to when the loan was advanced, in the opinion of this court, is not fatal to the case of the complainant since the complainant is a senior citizen.

It is further mentioned by the accused that he only signed the cheques and filled in the amount as opposed to him filing the columns of date, name of the payee alongwith amount and signatures as claimed by the complainant. However, no steps were taken by the accused to rebut the claim made by the complainant through any application for the expert examination of the concerned cheques. The accused also examined Sh. Deepak Kharbanda as a defence witness, however, nothing favourable emerged from the examination as the witness Sh. Deepak Kharbanda also failed to substantiate his testimony with any cogent proof. It is the testimony of Sh.Deepak Kharbanda that he used to work with the complainant in the business of property dealing as partners, however, no proof of that same was placed on record. Further Sh. Deepak Kharbanda submitted that the cheques in question were given to the complainant by the accused before him and no proof of the same has been placed on record. More importantly, Sh. Deepak Kharbanda mentioned a deal concerning a Janta Flats where the complainant and the accused were the buyers and further submitted that there was a bayana receipt in existence for the above mentioned transaction, however, the same could not be produced leaving the accused again empty handed in terms of substantial evidence. It is also pertinent to mention here that surprisingly there has been no mention of the above said transaction by the accused during the entire case.

20. The accused has also taken the defence that he did not receive the legal notice. During the trial, accused has never challenged the correctness of his address. He merely stated that it was not delivered to him. Personal delivery of notice is not a precondition for launching prosecution under Section 138 of the Act. In such cases, sending of notice at Hari Chand Batra v. Ashok Saxena/Kanojia CC No. 529664/2016 Page no. 12 the correct address is sufficient. It is not necessary that the notice must be received by the drawer of the cheque. The accused challenged the fact of non receipt of notice, however, he did not bring any cogent evidence showing non delivery of the same. The legal notice having been dispatched by Registered Post Ex. CW-1/7, there arose a presumption of due service as per Section 27 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 1 and Section 114 of the Indian Evidence Act, 18722 and now it was incumbent on the accused to lead evidence to prove that the same was not served on him. However, no evidence has been led to rebut the presumption of deemed service. In such circumstances, the legal notice can be presumed to have been served.

Reliance can be placed upon D. Vinod Shivapa v. Nanda Belliappa, 2006 (6) SCC 456, wherein it was held that when a notice is sent by the registered post and is returned with the postal endorsement 'refused' or 'unclaimed' or 'not available in the house' or 'house locked' or 'shop closed' or 'addressee not in station', due service has to be presumed. The question as to whether the service of notice has been fraudulently refused by unscrupulous means is as question of fact to be decided on the basis of evidence. In the case of C.C. Alavi Haji (supra), it was held that any drawer who claims that he did not receive the notice sent by post, can, within fifteen days of receipt of summons from the Court for complaint filed under Section 138 of the Act, make payment of cheque amount and makes submission to this effect before the Court and accordingly, the complaint is liable to be rejected. Where no payment is made under the above circumstances, such person can not contend that there was no proper service of notice as required under Section 138 of the Act, by ignoring statutory presumption to the contrary under Section 27 of The General Clauses Act and Section 114 of The Evidence Act. In view of the said interpretation, deemed service is to be accepted by the Court unless it is rebutted by leading cogent evidence.

21. In a negotiable instruments case, onus is upon the accused to rebut the presumption raised under Sections 118(a) and 139 of the said Act and merely taking a bald plea by stating that the cheques in question were given by him to the complainant as token cheques without the same being corroborated by any evidence is not sufficient to rebut the presumption.

1 Section 27 : Where any (Central Act) or Regulation made after the commencement of this Act authorizes of requires any document to be served by post, where the expression any other expression in used, then, unless a different intention appears, the service shall be deemed to be effected by properly addressing pre-paying and posting by registered post, a letter containing the document, and unless the contrary is proved, to have been effected at the time at which the letter would be delivered in the ordinary course of post. 2 Section 114 : The Court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particulars case.

Hari Chand Batra v. Ashok Saxena/Kanojia CC No. 529664/2016 Page no. 13

22. At the time of final arguments, Ld. Counsel for the accused also took a stand that there was no evidence placed on record that proved the financial capability of the complainant to advance the loan of the amount in question to the accused. I do not find merits in the submission of Ld. Counsel for the accused. Failure to disclose the loan in the ITRs and non filing of documents are not fatal to the case of the complainant especially when the same was never asked to be furnished by the accused throughout the trial. For this, reliance be placed on one judgment Sanjay Arora v. Monika Singh [2017 SCC Online Del 8897]. In that case, it was held that :

""24. mere admission of the complainant that he was earning only Rs.12,000/- per month from small business or his failure to file income tax returns, or his omission to produce the bank pass book or to examine Chhotu as a witness in corroboration, are inconsequential. In order to rebut the statutory presumption, it was the burden of the respondent to prove the facts she had pleaded in answer to the notice under Section 251 Cr.P.C."". Thus, there is no force in the submission of Counsel for the accused.",fm
". The requirements of justice give an occasion for the development of new dimension of justice by evolving juristic principles for doing complete justice according to the current needs of the Society. The quest for justice in the process of administration of justice occasions the evolution of new dimensions of the justice. J.S. Verma, J., in his Article ""New Dimensions of Justice"", (1997) 3 SCC J-3 observed that:-

""...Justice is the ideal to be achieved by Law. Justice is the goal of law. Law is a set of general rules applied in the administration of justice. Justice is in a cause on application of law to a particular case. Jurisprudence is the philosophy of law. Jurisprudence and Law have ultimately to be tested on the anvil of administration of justice. 'Law as it is', may fall short of 'Law as it ought to be' for doing complete justice in a cause. The gap between the two may be described as the field covered by Morality. There is no doubt that the development of the law is influenced by morals. The infusion of morality for reshaping the law is influenced by the principles of Equity and Natural Justice, as effective agencies of growth. The ideal State is when the rules of law satisfy the requirements of justice and the gap between the two is bridged. It is this attempt to bridge the gap which occasions the development of New Jurisprudence.
The existence of some gap between law and justice is recognized by the existing law itself. This is the reason for the recognition of inherent powers of the court by express provision made in the Code of Civil Procedure and the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Constitution of India by Article 142 expressly confers on the Supreme Court plenary powers for doing complete justice in any cause or matter before it. Such power in the court of last resort is recognition of the principle that in the justice delivery system, at the end point attempt must be made to do complete justice in every cause, if that result cannot be achieved by provisions of the enacted law. These powers are in addition to the discretionary powers of courts in certain areas where rigidity is considered inappropriate, e.g., equitable reliefs and Article 226 of the Constitution. ...""
Section 24 of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955

2. Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act empowers the Court to award maintenance pendente lite and litigation expenses to a party who has no independent income sufficient for his/her support in proceedings pending under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, having regard to the income of the parties. The Proviso to Section 24 provides that application under Section 24 shall be disposed of within 60 days of the date of service of notice on the opposite party.

3. Maintenance is not merely a legal right. It is part and parcel of basic human right. For weaker sections, it is a problem in the sense that their very survival rest on the maintenance. The object behind the provision is two-fold: firstly, to prevent vagrancy resulting from stained relation between the husband and wife, and secondly, to ensure that the indigent litigating spouse is not handicapped in defending or prosecuting the case due to want of money. On the breakdown of the marriage, it often so happens that the husband pays nothing for the support of his wife and children and the wife has to fall back upon her parents and relatives to fend her immediate needs. Reasonableness too demands extension of such a relief in favour of a needy spouse. Had not the parties drifted away from one another, the spouse from whom support is sought would have in any case supported the other spouse entailing financial burden. Hence, it is but natural to make the husband bear the cost of maintaining his wife pending disposal of any dispute until some permanent relief is provided to her.

4. In Bhuwan Mohan Singh v. Meena & Ors, AIR 2014 SC 2875 the Supreme Court held that any delay in adjudication of maintenance cases by the Family Court is not only against human rights but also against the basic embodiment of dignity of an individual. The object of the provisions for grant of maintenance is to provide speedy remedy for supply of food, clothing and shelter to the deserted wife and to prevent vagrancy and destitution. The observations of the Supreme Court are as under:

""2. The two issues that pronouncedly emanate in this appeal by special leave are whether the Family Court while deciding an application under Section 7 of the Family Court Act, 1984 (for brevity, ""the Act"") which includes determination of grant of maintenance to the persons as entitled under that provision, should allow adjournments in an extremely liberal manner remaining oblivious of objects and reasons of the Act and also keeping the windows of wisdom closed and the sense of judicial responsiveness suspended to the manifest perceptibility of vagrancy, destitution, impecuniosity, struggle for survival and the emotional fracture, a wife likely to face under these circumstances and further exhibiting absolute insensitivity to her condition, who, after loosing support of the husband who has failed to husband the marital status denies the wife to have maintenance for almost nine years as that much time is consumed to decide the lis and, in addition, to restrict the grant of maintenance to the date of order on some kind of individual notion. Both the approaches, as we perceive, not only defeat the command of the legislature but also frustrate the hope of wife and children who are deprived of adequate livelihood and whose aspirations perish like mushroom and possibly the brief candle of sustenance joins the marathon race of extinction. This delay in adjudication by the Family Court is not only against human rights but also against the basic embodiment of dignity of an individual.
3. Be it ingeminated that Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short ""the Code"") was conceived to ameliorate the agony, anguish, financial suffering of a woman who left her matrimonial home for the reasons provided in the provision so that some suitable arrangements can be made by the Court and she can sustain herself and also her children if they are with her. The concept of sustenance does not necessarily mean to lead the life of an animal, feel like an unperson to be thrown away from grace and roam for her basic maintenance somewhere else. She is entitled in law to lead a life in the similar manner as she would have lived in the house of her husband. That is where the status and strata come into play, and that is where the obligations of the husband, in case of a wife, become a prominent one. In a proceeding of this nature, the husband cannot take subterfuges to deprive her of the benefit of living with dignity. Regard being had to the solemn pledge at the time of marriage and also in consonance with the statutory law that governs the field, it is the obligation of the husband to see that the wife does not become a destitute, a beggar. A situation is not to be maladroitly created whereunder she is compelled to resign to her fate and think of life ""dust unto dust"". It is totally impermissible. In fact, it is the sacrosanct duty to render the financial support even if the husband is required to earn money with physical labour, if he is able bodied. There is no escape route unless there is an order from the Court that the wife is not entitled to get maintenance from the husband on any legally permissible grounds.
xxx xxx xxx
9. A three-Judge Bench in Vimla (K.) v. Veeraswamy (K.)[2], while discussing about the basic purpose under Section 125 of the Code, opined that Section 125 of the Code is meant to achieve a social purpose. The object is to prevent vagrancy and destitution. It provides a speedy remedy for the supply of food, clothing and shelter to the deserted wife.
xxx xxx xxx ...It has come to the notice of the Court that on certain occasions the Family Courts have been granting adjournments in a routine manner as a consequence of which both the parties suffer or, on certain occasions, the wife becomes the worst victim. When such a situation occurs, the purpose of the law gets totally atrophied. The Family Judge is expected to be sensitive to the issues, for he is dealing with extremely delicate and sensitive issues pertaining to the marriage and issues ancillary thereto. When we say this, we do not mean that the Family Courts should show undue haste or impatience, but there is a distinction between impatience and to be wisely anxious and conscious about dealing with a situation. A Family Court Judge should remember that the procrastination is the greatest assassin of the lis before it. It not only gives rise to more family problems but also gradually builds unthinkable and Everestine bitterness. It leads to the cold refrigeration of the hidden feelings, if still left. The delineation of the lis by the Family Judge must reveal the awareness and balance. Dilatory tactics by any of the parties has to be sternly dealt with, for the Family Court Judge has to be alive to the fact that the lis before him pertains to emotional fragmentation and delay can feed it to grow. We hope and trust that the Family Court Judges shall remain alert to this and decide the matters as expeditiously as possible keeping in view the objects and reasons of the Act and the scheme of various provisions pertaining to grant of maintenance, divorce, custody of child, property disputes, etc.""
(Emphasis supplied) Basis for the claim of maintenance
5. The basis of the claim for maintenance is that the claimant has no independent income to support herself and the Court has to take into consideration the income of both the parties. It is common knowledge that in maintenance cases parties rarely disclose their true income. The applicant is not generally aware of or is not in possession of documents from which the income of respondent can be ascertained. Such documents are accessible to the respondent only.

6. In Radhika v. Vineet Rungta, 110 (2004) DLT 111, this Court observed that parties rarely disclose their true income and therefore, the Court have to resort to the status and life style of the parties for fixing the maintenance. This Court held as under:

""3. Cases where the parties disclose their actual income are extremely rare. Experience, therefore, dictates that where a decision has to be taken pertaining to the claim for maintenance, and the quantum to be granted, the safer and surer method to be employed for coming to a realistic conclusion is to look at the status of the parties, since whilst incomes can be concealed, the status is palpably evident to all concerned. If any opulent lifestyle is enjoyed by warring spouses he should not be heard to complaint or plead that he has only a meagre income. If this approach had been followed, it would have been evident that the warring spouses enjoy a affluent lifestyle. It has already been noted that the learned Trial Court has not discussed the Husband's income. While granting maintenance it is incumbent on the Court to make such monetary arrangements as would be conducive to the spouses continuing a lifestyle to which they were accustomed before the matrimonial discord.""
(Emphasis supplied)
7. Burden of proving the income 7.1 The true income of the parties is within their personal knowledge and therefore, the onus to prove their true income is on them under Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act.
7.2 Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act reads as under:

""Section 106- Burden of proving fact especially within knowledge -
When any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him.""
7.3 The monthly income of the husband may not very often be within the knowledge of the wife, particularly in a case where the relationship is considerably strained and the spouses are living apart for a considerable period. Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act specifically casts the burden of proof of the income on the husband since the relevant facts relating to his income cannot be within the specific knowledge of the wife.

7.4 It is noticed that upon the failure of the husband to disclose his true income without good reasons, the Courts normally draw a presumption against him and accept the allegations of the wife as to the income of the husband. However, this Court has some reservation about accepting the preposition that whatever estranged wife states with or without rational basis should be accepted as gospel truth. One cannot be oblivious to the human feeling of an estranged wife to exaggerate income of her estranged husband to extract as much as possible due to every increasing lack of sense of security. Every Court is supposed to be circumspect to ensure that unconsciously by any such order the Court is not forcing one or the other party to the extremes. This Court is of the view that the parties should be directed to file a detailed affidavit of their assets, income and expenditure and the supporting documents in order to determine their true income.

7.5 This Court is of the view that the assets, liabilities, income and expenditure of the parties are necessary to be determined not only to fix the maintenance under Section 24 but also to determine the permanent alimony under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act and right to the joint properties under Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act. It is therefore necessary to formulate a format of the affidavit of assets, income and expenditure and also specify the documents to be disclosed by them. The format of the affidavit of assets, income and expenditure would help the Court in determining the true income, expenditure, assets and liabilities of the parties.

8. Section 10 of Family Courts Act, 1984 8.1 The Family Courts Act adopts a less formal procedure. Although Section 10 of the Act makes the procedure laid down under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 applicable to Family Court proceedings, it also lays down that the Family Court is free to evolve its own rules of procedure.

8.2 Section 10(3) of the Family Courts Act specifically uses the word 'truth' and casts a duty on the Family Court to lay down procedure to determine the truth of the facts alleged by one party and denied by the other. Section 10 of the Family Courts Act is reproduced hereunder:

""Section 10 - Procedure generally (1) Subject to the other provisions of this Act and the rules, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) and of any other law for the time being in force shall apply to the suits and proceedings other than proceedings under Chapter IX of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974)], before a Family Court and for the purposes of the said provisions of the Code, a Family Court shall be deemed to be a Civil Court and shall have all the powers of such Court. (2) Subject to the other provisions of this Act and the rules, the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, (2 of 1974), or the rules made thereunder, shall apply to the proceedings under Chapter IX of that Code before a Family Court.
(3) Nothing in sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) shall prevent a Family Court from laying down its own procedure with a view to arrive at a settlement in respect of the subject-matter of the suit or proceedings or at the truth of the facts alleged by the one party and denied by the other.""
9. Truth should be the Guiding Star in the Entire Judicial Process 9.1 It is the duty of the Court to ascertain the true income of the parties and then pass the appropriate order relating to maintenance. Truth is the foundation of justice. Dispensation of justice, based on truth, is an essential feature in the justice delivery system. People would have faith in Courts when truth alone triumphs. The justice based on truth would establish peace in the society.

9.2 Krishna Iyer J. in Jasraj Inder Singh v. Hemraj Multanchand, (1977) 2 SCC 155 described truth and justice as under:

""8. ...Truth, like song, is whole, and half-truth can be noise! Justice is truth, is beauty and the strategy of healing injustice is discovery of the whole truth and harmonising human relations. Law's finest hour is not in meditating on abstractions but in being the delivery agent of full fairness. This divagation is justified by the need to remind ourselves that the grammar of justice according to law is not little litigative solution of isolated problems but resolving the conflict in its wider bearings.""
(Emphasis supplied) 9.3 In Union Carbide Corporation v. Union of India, (1989) 3 SCC 38, the Supreme Court described justice and truth to mean the same. The observations of the Supreme Court are as under:
""30. ...when one speaks of justice and truth, these words mean the same thing to all men whose judgment is uncommitted. Of Truth and Justice, Anatole France said :
""Truth passes within herself a penetrating force unknown alike to error and falsehood. I say truth and you must understand my meaning. For the beautiful words Truth and Justice need not be defined in order to be understood in their true sense. They bear within them a shining beauty and a heavenly light. I firmly believe in the triumph of truth and justice. That is what upholds me in times of trial....""
(Emphasis supplied) 9.4 In Mohanlal Shamji Soni v. Union of India, 1991 Supp (1) SCC 271, the Supreme Court observed that the presiding officer of a Court should not simply sit as a mere umpire at a contest between two parties and declare at the end of the combat who has won and who has lost and that there is a legal duty of his own, independent of the parties, to take an active role in the proceedings in finding the truth and administering justice.
9.5 In Chandra Shashi v. Anil Kumar Verma, (1995) 1 SCC 421, the Supreme Court observed that to enable the Courts to ward off unjustified interference in their working, those who indulge in immoral acts like perjury, pre-variation and motivated falsehoods have to be appropriately dealt with, without which it would not be possible for any Court to administer justice in the true sense and to the satisfaction of those who approach it in the hope that truth would ultimately prevail. People would have faith in Courts when they would find that truth alone triumphs in Courts.

9.6 In Zahira Habibullah Sheikh v. State of Gujarat, (2006) 3 SCC 374, the Supreme Court observed that right from the inception of the judicial system it has been accepted that discovery, vindication and establishment of truth are the main purposes underlying existence of Courts of justice.

9.7 In Himanshu Singh Sabharwal v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (2008) 3 SCC 602, the Supreme Court held that the trial should be a search for the truth and not about over technicalities. The Supreme Court's observation are as under:

""5. ... 31. In 1846, in a judgment which Lord Chancellor Selborne would later describe as 'one of the ablest judgments of one of the ablest judges who ever sat in this Court', Vice-Chancellor Knight Bruce said [Pearse v. Pearse, (1846) 1 De G&Sm. 12 : 16 LJ Ch 153 : 63 ER 950 : 18 Digest (Repl.) 91, 748] : (De G&Sm. pp. 28-29):
""31. The discovery and vindication and establishment of truth are main purposes certainly of the existence of courts of justice; still, for the obtaining of these objects, which, however valuable and important, cannot be usefully pursued without moderation, cannot be either usefully or creditably pursued unfairly or gained by unfair means, not every channel is or ought to be open to them. The practical inefficacy of torture is not, I suppose, the most weighty objection to that mode of examination,... Truth, like all other good things, may be loved unwisely--may be pursued too keenly--may cost too much.
xxx xxx xxx
35. Courts have always been considered to have an overriding duty to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice--often referred to as the duty to vindicate and uphold the 'majesty of the law'.
(Emphasis Supplied) 9.8 In Maria Margarida Sequeria Fernandes v. Erasmo Jack de Sequeria, (2012) 5 SCC 370, the Supreme Court again highlighted the significance of truth and observed that the truth should be the guiding star in the entire legal process and it is the duty of the Judge to discover truth to do complete justice.
The Supreme Court stressed that Judge has to play an active role to discover the truth and he should explore all avenues open to him in order to discover the truth. The Supreme Court observed as under:

""32. In this unfortunate litigation, the Court's serious endeavour has to be to find out where in fact the truth lies.
33. The truth should be the guiding star in the entire judicial process.Truth alone has to be the foundation of justice. The entire judicial system has been created only to discern and find out the real truth. Judges at all levels have to seriously engage themselves in the journey of discovering the truth. That is their mandate, obligation and bounden duty. Justice system will acquire credibility only when people will be convinced that justice is based on the foundation of the truth.
xxx xxx xxx
35. What people expect is that the Court should discharge its obligation to find out where in fact the truth lies. Right from inception of the judicial system it has been accepted that discovery, vindication and establishment of truth are the main purposes underlying the existence of the courts of justice.
xxx xxx xxx
52. Truth is the foundation of justice. It must be the endeavour of all the judicial officers and judges to ascertain truth in every matter and no stone should be left unturned in achieving this object. Courts must give greater emphasis on the veracity of pleadings and documents in order to ascertain the truth.""
(Emphasis supplied)
10. False claims and defences 10.1 In Dalip Singh v. State of U.P., (2010) 2 SCC 114, the Supreme Court observed that a new creed of litigants have cropped up in the last 40 years who do not have any respect for truth and shamelessly resort to falsehood and unethical means for achieving their goals. The observations of the Supreme Court are as under:-
""1. For many centuries, Indian society cherished two basic values of life i.e., 'Satya' (truth) and 'Ahimsa' (non- violence). Mahavir, Gautam Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi guided the people to ingrain these values in their daily life. Truth constituted an integral part of the justice- delivery system which was in vogue in the pre- Independence era and the people used to feel proud to tell truth in the courts irrespective of the consequences. However, post-Independence period has seen drastic changes in our value system. The materialism has over shadowed the old ethos and the quest for personal gain has become so intense that those involved in litigation do not hesitate to take shelter of falsehood, misrepresentation and suppression of facts in the court proceedings.
2. In last 40 years, a new creed of litigants has cropped up. Those who belong to this creed do not have any respect for truth. They shamelessly resort to falsehood and unethical means for achieving their goals. In order to meet the challenge posed by this new creed of litigants, the courts have, from time to time, evolved new rules and it is now well established that a litigant, who attempts to pollute the stream of justice or who touches the pure fountain of justice with tainted hands, is not entitled to any relief, interim or final.""
(Emphasis supplied) 10.2 In Satyender Singh v. Gulab Singh, 2012 (129) DRJ 128, the Division Bench of this Court following Dalip Singh v. State of U.P. (supra) observed that the Courts are flooded with litigation with false and incoherent pleas and tainted evidence led by the parties due to which the judicial system in the country is choked and such litigants are consuming Court's time for a wrong cause.
The observations of this Court are as under:-

""2. As rightly observed by the Supreme Court, Satya is a basic value of life which was required to be followed by everybody and is recognized since many centuries. In spite of caution, courts are continued to be flooded with litigation with false and incoherent pleas and tainted evidence led by the parties. The judicial system in the country is choked and such litigants are consuming courts' time for a wrong cause. Efforts are made by the parties to steal a march over their rivals by resorting to false and incoherent statements made before the Court. Indeed, it is a nightmare faced by a Trier of Facts; required to stitch a garment, when confronted with a fabric where the weft, shuttling back and forth across the warp in weaving, is nothing but lies. As the threads of the weft fall, the yarn of the warp also collapses; and there is no fabric left.""

11. Imposition of costs 11.1 In Ramrameshwari Devi v. Nirmala Devi, (2011) 8 SCC 249, the Supreme Court has held that the Courts have to take into consideration pragmatic realities and have to be realistic in imposing the costs. The relevant paragraphs of the said judgment are reproduced hereunder:-
""43. ...We are clearly of the view that unless we ensure that wrongdoers are denied profit or undue benefit from the frivolous litigation, it would be difficult to control frivolous and uncalled for litigations. In order to curb uncalled for and frivolous litigation, the courts have to ensure that there is no incentive or motive for uncalled for litigation. It is a matter of common experience that court's otherwise scarce and valuable time is consumed or more appropriately wasted in a large number of uncalled for cases.
xxx xxx xxx
52. The main question which arises for our consideration is whether the prevailing delay in civil litigation can be curbed? In our considered opinion the existing system can be drastically changed or improved if the following steps are taken by the trial courts while dealing with the civil trials.
xxx xxx xxx C. Imposition of actual, realistic or proper costs and or ordering prosecution would go a long way in controlling the tendency of introducing false pleadings and forged and fabricated documents by the litigants. Imposition of heavy costs would also control unnecessary adjournments by the parties. In appropriate cases the courts may consider ordering prosecution otherwise it may not be possible to maintain purity and sanctity of judicial proceedings...
xxx xxx xxx
54. While imposing costs we have to take into consideration pragmatic realities and be realistic what the Defendants or the Respondents had to actually incur in contesting the litigation before different courts. We have to also broadly take into consideration the prevalent fee structure of the lawyers and other miscellaneous expenses which have to be incurred towards drafting and filing of the counter affidavit, miscellaneous charges towards typing, photocopying, court fee etc.
55. The other factor which should not be forgotten while imposing costs is for how long the Defendants or Respondents were compelled to contest and defend the litigation in various courts. The Appellants in the instant case have harassed the Respondents to the hilt for four decades in a totally frivolous and dishonest litigation in various courts. The Appellants have also wasted judicial time of the various courts for the last 40 years.
56. On consideration of totality of the facts and circumstances of this case, we do not find any infirmity in the well reasoned impugned order/judgment. These appeals are consequently dismissed with costs, which we quantify as Rs. 2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakhs only). We are imposing the costs not out of anguish but by following the fundamental principle that wrongdoers should not get benefit out of frivolous litigation....""
(Emphasis supplied) 11.2 In Maria Margarida Sequeria Fernandes v. Erasmo Jack de Sequeria (supra) the Supreme Court held that heavy costs and prosecution should be ordered in cases of false claims and defences. The Supreme Court held as under:-
""82. This Court in a recent judgment in Ramrameshwari Devi and Ors. (supra) aptly observed at page 266, para 43 that unless wrongdoers are denied profit from frivolous litigation, it would be difficult to prevent it. In order to curb uncalled for and frivolous litigation, the Courts have to ensure that there is no incentive or motive for uncalled for litigation. It is a matter of common experience that Court's otherwise scarce time is consumed or more appropriately, wasted in a large number of uncalled for cases. In this very judgment, the Court provided that this problem can be solved or at least be minimized if exemplary cost is imposed for instituting frivolous litigation. The Court observed at pages 267-268 that imposition of actual, realistic or proper costs and/or ordering prosecution in appropriate cases would go a long way in controlling the tendency of introducing false pleadings and forged and fabricated documents by the litigants. Imposition of heavy costs would also control unnecessary adjournments by the parties. In appropriate cases, the Courts may consider ordering prosecution otherwise it may not be possible to maintain purity and sanctity of judicial proceedings.""
12. Judge's Power to put questions or order production 12.1 Section 165 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 invests the Judge with plenary powers to put any question to any witness or party; in any form, at any time, about any fact relevant or irrelevant. Section 165 is intended to arm the Judge with the most extensive power possible for the purpose of getting at the truth.
The effect of this section is that in order to get to the bottom of the matter before it, the Court will be able to look at and inquire into every fact and thus possibly acquire valuable indicative evidence which may lead to other evidence strictly relevant and admissible. The Court is not, however, permitted to found its judgment on any but relevant statements.

12.2 Section 165 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 reads as under:

""Section 165. Judge's power to put questions or order production.-
The Judge may, in order to discover or obtain proper proof of relevant facts, ask any question he pleases, in any form, at any time, of any witness, or of the parties, about any fact relevant or irrelevant; and may order the production of any document or thing; and neither the parties nor their agents shall be entitled to make any objection to any such question or order, nor, without the leave of the Court, to cross-examine any witness upon any answer given in reply to any such question: Provided that the judgment must be based upon facts declared by this Act to be relevant, and duly proved: Provided also that this section shall not authorize any Judge to compel any witness to answer any question or to produce any document which such witness would be entitled to refuse to answer or produce under Sections 121 to 131, both inclusive, if the question were asked or the document were called for by the adverse party; nor shall the Judge ask any question which it would be improper for any other person to ask under Section 148 or 149 ; nor shall he dispense with primary evidence of any document, except in the cases herein before excepted.""
12.3 The object of a trial is, first to ascertain truth by the light of reason, and then, do justice upon the basis of the truth and the Judge is not only justified but required to elicit a fact, wherever the interest of truth and justice would suffer, if he did not.

12.4 The Judge contemplated by Section 165 is not a mere umpire at a wit-combat between the lawyers for the parties whose only duty is to enforce the rules of the game and declare at the end of the combat who has won and who has lost. He is expected, and indeed it is his duty, to explore all avenues open to him in order to discover the truth and to that end, question witnesses on points which the lawyers for the parties have either overlooked or left obscure or willfully avoided. A Judge, who at the trial merely sits and records evidence without caring so to conduct the examination of the witnesses that every point is brought out, is not fulfilling his duty.

12.5 The Supreme Court in Ram Chander v. State of Haryana, (1981) 3 SCC 191 observed that under Section 165, the Court has ample power and discretion to control the trial effectively. While conducting trial, the Court is not required to sit as a silent spectator or umpire but to take active part within the boundaries of law by putting questions to witnesses in order to elicit the truth and to protect the weak and the innocent. It is the duty of a Judge to discover the truth and for that purpose he may ""ask any question, in any form, at any time, of any witness, or of the parties, about any fact, relevant or irrelevant"".

12.6 In Ritesh Tewari v. State of Uttar Pradesh, (2010) 10 SCC 677, the Supreme Court held that every trial is a voyage of discovery in which truth is the quest. The power under Section 165 is to be exercised with the object of subserving the cause of justice and public interest, and for getting the evidence in aid of a just decision and to uphold the truth. It is an extraordinary power conferred upon the Court to elicit the truth and to act in the interest of justice. The purpose being to secure justice by full discovery of truth and an accurate knowledge of facts, the Court can put questions to the parties, except those which fall within exceptions contained in the said provision itself.

12.7 In State of Rajasthan v. Ani, (1997) 6 SCC162, the Supreme Court held that Section 165 of the Indian Evidence Act confers vast and unrestricted powers on the Court to elicit truth. Reticence may be good in many circumstances, but a Judge remaining mute during trial is not an ideal situation. A taciturn Judge may be the model caricatured in public mind. But there is nothing wrong in his becoming active or dynamic during trial so that criminal justice being the end could be achieved. A Judge is expected to actively participate in the trial to elicit necessary materials from witnesses in the appropriate context which he feels necessary for reaching the correct conclusion.

Order 21 Rule 41(2) further empowers the Court to direct the judgment debtor to file an affidavit stating the particulars of the assets of the judgment debtor. Upon disobedience of such an order, Order 21 Rule 41(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure empowers the Court to send the judgment debtor to civil prison for a term not exceeding three months.

15.2 The form of the affidavit required to be filed by the judgment debtor under Order 21 Rule 41(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure is provided in Form 16-A in Appendix E.

15.3 Initially the Matrimonial Courts were directing the parties to file the affidavit in the format given in Form 16-A of Appendix E under Order 21 Rule 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure but the litigants were not truly disclosing their income in the said affidavit.

15.4 This Court is of the view that the format of affidavit of assets, income and expenditure provided in Form 16-A of Appendix E of the Code of Civil Procedure is not comprehensive to discover the complete income, assets and expenditure of the parties in matrimonial litigation and therefore, there is a need to formulate a comprehensive affidavit of assets, income and expenditure.

"MANMOHAN, J:

I.A. 4780/2014

1. Present application being I.A. 4780/2014 has been filed under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC on behalf of the defendants No.1, 2 and 5 for rejection of the plaint filed by the minor plaintiffs through their mother.

2. It is pertinent to mention that the present suit has been filed seeking partition, rendition of accounts and permanent injunction against their grandparents i.e. defendants No.1 and 5 as well as their father (defendant No.4) and aunt and uncle i.e. defendants No.2 and 3.

3. The learned Predecessor of this Court vide ex parte ad interim order dated 02nd December, 2013, directed the defendants to maintain status quo with regard to suit property bearing No.C-117, East of Kailash, New Delhi- 110065 as regards possession and title. On 27th September, 2018, this Court clarified that it had not granted any stay of proceedings in Appeal No.30/2013 i.e. Kuldeep Singh Gulati and Anr. Vs. Sandeep Gulati & Anr. pending under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2017 before the Divisional Commissioner and the said forum was free to proceed with the case, in the event there was no stay order passed by any other Court.

ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANTS NO.1, 2 AND 5

4. At the outset, Mr. V.K. Bali, learned senior counsel for defendant No.1, 2 and 5-applicants, submitted that the present suit was not maintainable as an identical suit of the father of plaintiffs being CS(OS) 886/2013 with the same averments and seeking the same relief, after hearing arguments on the very first date of hearing, had been dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to file other proceedings that may be permissible. The order dated 13th May, 2013 is reproduced hereinbelow:-

âPresent suit has been filed for partition, rendition of accounts and permanent injunction.
As this Court after hearing some arguments was of the view that present suit for partition was not maintainable, Mr. Bhupesh Narula, learned counsel for the plaintiff wishes to withdraw the present suit with liberty to avail other appropriate remedies that may be available to the plaintiff in accordance with law.
With the aforesaid liberty, present suit and applications are dismissed as withdrawn.â
5. Mr. Bali stated that since the plaintiffs i.e. children of the defendant No. 4 derive their title from their father, if defendant No. 4 can file proceedings other than the partition suit, then his children who derive title from him, cannot file a partition suit.

6. He pointed out that the father of the plaintiffs i.e. defendant No.4 (Mr. Sandeep Gulati) had been involved in a murder case at the age of sixteen and the present suit had been filed by him through his two minor children from the third wife and that too without seeking any claim/share for his son from the first wife.

7. Learned senior counsel for defendants No.1, 2 and 5 stated that in 1947, late Sh. R.P. Gulati had migrated from Pakistan to India with his family members leaving behind all their belongings. He pointed out that while migrating to India all the family members were searched and they were not allowed to carry anything. He emphasized that late Sh. R.P. Gulati had arrived in India along with his family members with only the clothes which they were wearing, and thus it was very hard for him even to meet the basic needs of the family and due to the same, his eldest son Sh. D.L. Gulati, who was sixteen years of age at that time started working.

8. Mr. Bali stated that at the time of death of Sh. R.P. Gulati in 1971, he had no business and he was fully dependent upon his children, and therefore, no property or business was left by late Sh. R.P. Gulati. He contended that the question of inheriting any family business or coparcenary business did not arise. He showed an extract of the passbook of Mr. R.P. Gulati, which showed a balance of just Rs.4.15/- in August, 1970. He also referred to the Central Govt. Health Scheme Card of Sh. R.L. Gulati, son of late Sh. R.P. Gulati to show that he was dependant on his son for his own medical treatment.

9. Learned senior counsel for defendants No.1, 2 and 5-applicants contended that there was no averment in the plaint that Mr. R.P. Gulati, great grandfather of the plaintiffs, had succeeded to any property on demise of his father. He pointed out that there was not even a whisper in the plaint as to what properties were owned by the father of Mr. R.P. Gulati or even by Mr. R.P. Gulati himself. He emphasized that no details of any business or property being inherited by defendant No.1 on the death of Mr. R.P. Gulati had been mentioned in the plaint.

10. Mr. Bali submitted that coparcenary is a creation of law and cannot be created by an act of the parties. He pointed out that in the present case there was no coparcenary property specified or even named and no averment with regard to the hotchpotch or actual blending of properties by the parties. According to him, the only averments in the plaint were with regard to blending of income from salaries. He stated that all the three partnership firms mentioned in the plaint as businesses of the coparcenary had been formed after the death of Mr. R.P. Gulati in 1971.

11. In the alternative, Mr. Bali submitted that even if it was assumed that coparcenary/Hindu Undivided Family properties were in existence, no coparcenary survived in the present case as, according to the plaintiffs themselves, there had been four partitions. He pointed out that upon separation of two brothers of defendant No.1 there was a partition in 1971 and upon separation of third brother, there was another partition in September, 1974. Further, three brothers of defendant No.1 separated in April, 1989 and one son of the defendant No.1 separated and moved to Canada on 17th March, 2004.

12. According to him, when partition of a coparcenary takes place and shares of the members get ascertained, the coparcenary dissolves and thereafter any branch wise division/partition/sub-division is not permissible under Hindu law.

13. Learned senior counsel for defendants No.1, 2 and 5-applicants stated that the dispute in the present case is primarily with regard to a house situated at C-117, East of Kailash, New Delhi. He stated that the said house was purchased and is owned by defendant No.5, grandmother of the plaintiffs. In support of his contention, he relied upon the Agreement to Sell dated 06th May, 1978 as well as the receipt and Conveyance Deed dated 14th October, 1996.

14. He submitted that defendant No.5 being a female could not be a coparcener prior to 2005. He pointed out that it was the plaintiffs' own case that shares of males in 1989 partition were ascertained and no share was given to the females as they were not entitled to the same.

15. Mr. Bali contended that the plaintiffs have admitted to there being no Hindu Joint Family or Hindu Joint Family properties in the Memorandum of Settlement dated 17th March, 2004. He pointed out that by way of amendment application, the plaintiffs had partially challenged the said Memorandum of Settlement only to the extent that it affected their rights. He submitted that the plaintiffs cannot challenge it in a piecemeal manner. He stated that if the said family settlement was set aside, it would mean that Mr. Manit Gulati's (defendant No.3) separation would have to be set aside in its entirety.

16. He further submitted that the challenge to the said Memorandum of Settlement was beyond limitation and in support of his submission, he relied upon Section 7, Explanation II of the Limitation Act, 1963, which reads as under:-

â7. Disability of one of several persons.--Where one of several persons jointly entitled to institute a suit or make an application for the execution of a decree is under any such disability, and a discharge can be given without the concurrence of such person, time will run against them all; but, where no such discharge can be given, time will not run as against any of them until one of them becomes capable of giving such discharge without the concurrence of the others or until the disability has ceased.
Explanation I.-- This section applies to a discharge from every kind of liability, including a liability in respect of any immovable property.
Explanation II.-- For the purposes of this section, the manager of a Hindu undivided family governed by the Mitakshara law shall be deemed to be capable of giving a discharge without the concurrence of the other members of the family only if he is in management of the joint family property.
17. Learned senior counsel for defendants No.1, 2 and 5-applicants submitted that a suit for injunction against the Karta i.e. defendant No.1 is barred by provisions of Specific Relief Act, 1963 and no injunction could be passed against the Karta of a Hindu coparcenary as Karta is entitled to exclusive and entire possession.

18. Mr. Bali stated that the balance of convenience was entirely in favour of the defendants No.1, 2 and 5. He emphasised that Mr. Sandeep Gulati, father of the plaintiffs was in the possession of all cars of the family as well as the factory and warehouse which were yielding rental incomes. He contended that the mala fides of the plaintiffs would be apparent from the fact that defendant No. 4's business in China and house in Dwarka had not been made a part of the partition suit.

ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF PLAINTIFFS

19. Per contra, Mr. T.K. Ganju, learned senior counsel for plaintiffs submitted that despite the withdrawal of defendant No.4's suit being CS(OS) 886/2013, the present suit was maintainable as the right to demand partition and separate possession is a recurring right. In support of his submission, he relied upon the judgments of this Court in Sri Kishan Vs. Shri Ram Kishan & Ors., 2009 (110) DRJ 323 and Jai Devi Vs. Jodhi Ram, 1970 LawSuit(Del) 82.

20. He stated that prior to the disputes having arisen in 2010, the entire family i.e. the plaintiffs and the defendants were living together in the same house with a joint kitchen. He contended that the Family of defendant No.1 was a Hindu Joint Family as they had been joint in food, worship and estate. He submitted that there is a presumption in law that every Hindu family is a Hindu Joint Family which is joint in food, worship and estate, unless there is proof to the contrary. In support of his submission, he relied upon the judgment of Sanwal Das Vs. Kuremal & Ors. AIR 1928 Lah. 224 wherein it has been held, ""....The presumption of Hindu law is that every Hindu family is joint in food, worship and estate, and that a party who desires to establish the contrary must prove it....""

21. Mr. Ganju emphasised that in the present case, the factum of existence of an HUF under the name of ""K.S. Gulati and Sons HUF"" was an admitted fact. In support of his contention, he referred to Kuldeep Singh Gulati and Sons HUF Pan card details along with acknowledgment from the Income Tax Department.

22. Mr. Ganju submitted that as soon as the defendant No.4 i.e. father of the minor plaintiffs was born in 1969, by operation of law, a coparcenary came into existence. In support of his submission, he relied upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in Rohit Chauhan Vs. Surinder Singh & Ors., (2013) 9 SCC 419 wherein it has been held as under:-

""11. ....It is not static. We are further of the opinion that so long, on partition an ancestral property remains in the hand of a single person, it has to be treated as a separate property and such a person shall be entitled to dispose of the coparcenary property treating it to be his separate property but if a son is subsequently born, the alienation made before the birth cannot be questioned. But, the moment a son is born, the property becomes a coparcenary property and the son would acquire interest in that and become a coparcener.""
(emphasis supplied)
23. Learned senior counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the aforesaid judgment in Rohit Chauhan Vs. Surinder Singh & Ors.(supra) had been reiterated subsequently in Danamma alias Suman Surpur & Anr. Vs. Amar & Ors., (2018) 3 SCC 343 and Shyam Narayan Prasad Vs. Krishna Prasad & Ors., (2018) 7 SCC 646.
24. Mr. Ganju stated that after the great grandfather of the plaintiffs i.e. Mr. R.P. Gulati came from Pakistan in 1947, he got compensation from the Settlement Commission for the family properties left behind in Pakistan and with this compensation, he started a joint family business, being a shoe business in Lajpat Nagar, New Delhi. In support of his contention, he referred to the Income Tax Assessment order dated 31st March, 1986.

25. He further stated that after Mr. R.P. Gulati's death, the members of his family i.e. his sons amongst themselves, carried on family business under three partnership firms i.e. (i) M/s. Ofag International, (ii) M/s. Pishori Traders and (iii) M/s. Lloyd Steel, wherein Mrs. Surinder Gulati-defendant No.5 i.e. grandmother of the plaintiffs, represented the family group of K.S. Gulati and Sons, as Mr. K.S. Gulati was in Government service at that point in time.

26. Mr. Ganju contended that from the income derived from the three joint family partnership firms, the K.S. Gulati joint family purchased a plot of land bearing No.C-117, East of Kailash, in the name of Mrs. Surinder Gulati-defendant No.5.

27. Mr. Ganju contended that since in the present case, the plaintiffs had shown a nucleus from which the Hindu Joint Family properties had been acquired, there arose a presumption in law that such properties were Hindu Joint Family properties unless proved to the contrary by the person claiming it to be his self acquired property. In support of his submission, he relied upon a judgment of the Supreme Court in Appasaheb Peerappa Chamdgade Vs. Devendra Peerappa Chamdgade & Ors., (2007) 1 SCC 521 wherein it has been held as under:-

"" 13. ....But where it is established that the family possessed some joint property which from its nature and relative value may have formed the nucleus from which the property in question may have been acquired, the burden shifts to the party alleging self-acquisition to establish affirmatively that the property was acquired without the aid of the joint family property. Therefore, so far as the proposition of law is concerned, the initial burden is on the person who claims that it was joint family property but after initial discharge of the burden, it shifts to the party who claims that the property has been purchased by him through his own source and not from the joint family nucleus....""
28. Mr. Ganju stated that even if it is presumed that the plaintiffs had failed to prove the existence of a nucleus, then also as, in the present instance, the father and the son had worked together and created income and acquired properties with the help of their joint labour and effort--the said income and properties would be Hindu Joint Family properties unless proved to the contrary by the cogent evidence. He stated that the fact that defendants No.1, 2 and 4 had been working together in the family businesses since attaining majority and had been taking active part in the business of K.S. Gulati and Sons Hindu Joint Family since 1990 had been admitted by the defendants in C.P. No.06/1993. The relevant portion of the said reply affidavit by defendant No.1 relied upon by the learned senior counsel for plaintiffs is reproduced hereinbelow:-

""H. ....Naturally, the wives were only tax fronts and actual business was conducted by the husbands. The answering respondent looked after the technical side whereas the management of the various units was handled by his two brothers. Although the division of the shares of the Company amongst the three families was disproportionate, it was clearly understood that all the three had equal stakes therein like in the entire family business.""
29. He contended that in view of the said fact, even the pre-existence of a nucleus was not necessary. In support of his submission, Mr. Ganju relied upon the following judgments:-

A. Sanwal Das Vs. Kuremal & Ors. AIR 1928 Lah. 224 wherein it has been held as under:-

"" In Laldas Naraindas Vs. Motibai (6), it was held that, where a father and his sons acquire their property by their joint labours and are besides joint in food and worship, they must be regarded as having constituted a joint hindu family even though there may have been no nucleus of property which has come down to the father from his father or grandfather or great-grandfather. For the formation of a coparcenary in Hindu law, such a nucleus is not absolutely necessary, provided the persons constituting it stand in relationship of father and son or other relationship requisite for a coparcenary system.""

B. Madanlal (Dead) By LRs. & Ors. Vs. Yoga Bai (Dead) By LRs., (2003) 5 SCC 89,wherein it has been held as under:

""4. .....Therefore, the High Court found that the question which was to be considered was as to whether the property acquired by the father and the sons by putting their efforts together in their family business would be amenable to partition at the instance of the sons or not. Referring to several decisions of different High Courts, namely, Bombay High Court, Oudh Chief Court, Madras High Court as well as the Andhra Pradesh High Court on the point, it came to the conclusion that the property in question was raised and developed by the joint efforts of Purandas and his sons and therefore it was joint family property, amenable to partition among the father and sons etc. We do not find any flaw in the conclusion drawn by the High Court on the point enumerated above.

xxx xxx xxx

6. .... It is sought to be established that they have been running their business separately under different partnerships. We feel that no such inference can be drawn. In a family which carries on a number of businesses, it is quite often that it is carried out under different names and styles and often constitutes different companies or partnerships for better handling of business or to keep it manageable or for various other reasons. It is no proof of separation nor are the letters which are sought to be relied upon, written to the Income Tax Authorities and the assessment orders passed by the Income Tax Authorities....""

30. Mr. Ganju submitted that the fact whether the thirteen properties claimed to be Hindu Joint Family properties were available for partition or not, was a question of fact which could be determined only after conducting a trial and not in an application under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC. In support of his submission, he relied upon the following judgments:-

A. Kamala & Ors. Vs. K.T. Eshwara Sa & Ors., (2008) 12 SCC 661 wherein it has been held as under:-

""21. Order 7 Rule 11(d) of the Code has limited application. It must be shown that the suit is barred under any law. Such a conclusion must be drawn from the averments made in the plaint. Different clauses in Order 7 Rule 11, in our opinion, should not be mixed up. Whereas in a given case, an application for rejection of the plaint may be filed on more than one ground specified in various sub-clauses thereof, a clear finding to that effect must be arrived at. What would be relevant for invoking clause (d) of Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code are the averments made in the plaint. For that purpose, there cannot be any addition or subtraction. Absence of jurisdiction on the part of a court can be invoked at different stages and under different provisions of the Code. Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code is one, Order 14 Rule 2 is another.

22. For the purpose of invoking Order 7 Rule 11(d) of the Code, no amount of evidence can be looked into. The issues on merit of the matter which may arise between the parties would not be within the realm of the court at that stage. All issues shall not be the subject-matter of an order under the said provision.

xxx xxx xxx

32. We may proceed on the assumption that the shares of the parties were defined. There was a partition amongst the parties in the sense that they could transfer their undivided share. What would, however, be the effect of a partition suit which had not been taken to its logical conclusion by getting the properties partitioned by metes and bounds is a question which, in our opinion, cannot be gone into in a proceeding under Order 7 Rule 11(d) of the Code. Whether any property is available for partition is itself a question of fact.

xxx xxx xxx

37. What would be its effect is again a question which cannot fall for determination under Order 7 Rule 11(d) of the Code. These facts require adjudication. The identity of the properties which were the subject-matter of the earlier suit vis-Ã -vis the properties which were subsequently acquired and the effect thereof is beyond the purview of Order 7 Rule 11(d) of the Code.

38. Whether the properties mentioned in the plaint are available for partition is essentially a question of fact. Whether an order of injunction was obtained on the basis of a misleading statement in the earlier suit or whether they were entitled therefor are not the questions which, in our opinion, can be gone into at this stage. Moreover, it is contended that some lands have been acquired by the Bangalore Development Authority. But, we do not know in whose favour the awards were made and even if somebody has received the awarded amount, what would be the effect thereof.""

B. Ms. Ilaria Kapur Vs. Sh. Rakesh Kapur & Ors., 2012 SCC OnLine Del 3115, wherein it has been held as under: ""21. Before embarking upon the merits of the respective contentions of the parties, it deserves to be highlighted that the scope and ambit of Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure is a cabined and limited one. As held in Kamala's case(supra), the conclusion that the suit is barred under any law must be drawn from the averments made in the plaint. Further, for invoking Rule 11(d) of Order VII, no amount of evidence can be looked into. The issues on the merits of the matter which may arise between the parties would not be within the realm of the Court at that stage nor shall form the subject matter of an order under the said provision, in the aforesaid decision which also pertains to a partition suit, it was observed (AIR, page No. 3179):--

âwhether any property is available for partition is itself a question of fact.â

22. In the case of Kamala (supra), a suit was filed claiming partition in the properties. After the passing of the preliminary decree, no property was available for partition. The properties were possessed by the co-sharers independenty in accordance with the respective shares held by the co-sharers. Yet, the Supreme Court observed that what would be the effect of a partition suit which had not been taken to its logical conclusion by getting the properties partitioned by metes and bounds is a question which cannot be gone into in a proceeding under Order VII, Rule 11(d) of the Code. Whether any property is available for partition is itself a question of fact. Identity of properties which were subject matter of the earlier suit, vis-a-vis, properties which were subsequently acquired and effect thereof was beyond the purview of Order VII, Rule 11(d).""

31. Mr. Ganju lastly contended that the balance of convenience was entirely in favour of the plaintiffs. He stated that father of the plaintiffs had been acquitted in the murder case and, if the interim order was not continued, the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable loss and injury inasmuch as they may be ousted from the Hindu Joint Family properties in which they have a right and the same shall cause irreparable loss and injury to them.

REJOINDER ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANTS NO.1, 2 AND 5.

32. In rejoinder, Mr. Bali stated that the plaintiffs' submission that the parties were coparceners in a joint family property was predicated on a wrong assumption of law that property granted to an individual/displaced person at the time of partition retained the same characteristic of the property that was left by the displaced person/persons in Pakistan. He submitted that the property, if any, allotted in lieu of the property left in Pakistan under Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1954 was a grant and consequently, a self-acquired property of defendant No.1.

33. Learned senior counsel for defendants No.1, 2 and 5 further submitted that the Lahore High Court in Sanwal Das Vs. Kuremal & Ors. (supra) erroneously held, by differing from three earlier judgments of the Lahore High Court, that when father and son work together, properties acquired would be Hindu Joint Family properties. He submitted that the Supreme Court in the following three judgements has held to the contrary :-

i) Appasheb Peerappa Chamdgagde Vs. Devender Peerappa Chamdgade and Others, (2007) 1 SCC 521
ii) Mudi Gowda Gowdappa Sankh Vs. Ram Chandra Ravagowda Sankh, (1969) 1 SCC 386
iii) D.S. Lakshmaiah and Anr. Vs. I. Balasubramanyam and Anr., (2003) 10 SCC 310.
34. Learned senior counsel for defendants No.1, 2 and 5 submitted that in a subsequent judgment of Uttam Vs. Saubhag Singh, (2016) 4 SCC 68, it has been specifically held that Rohit Chauhan's (supra) judgment is not good law.

35. Mr. Bali further stated that there is no averment in the plaint to the effect that the grandfather (defendant No.1) and the father (defendant No.4) of the plaintiffs had worked together and created income and acquired properties with the help of their joint labour and effort.

36. Learned senior counsel for defendants No.1, 2 and 5 lastly contended that though the plaintiffs were aware of the reply to the company petition being Co.Pet.6/1993 prior to the institution of the suit, yet there was no averment in the plaint with regard to the Company Law Board proceeding. Consequently, he submitted that the said allegation cannot be examined by the Court while dealing with an Order 7 Rule 11 CPC application.

COURT'S REASONING THE APPROACH TO BE ADOPTED BY THE COURTS WHILE DEALING WITH AN ORDER 7 RULE 11 CPC APPLICATION

37. Order 7 Rule 11 CPC lays down six grounds on which a plaint can be rejected. Though it is settled law that while deciding such an application what has to be seen are the averments made in the plaint, yet the sine qua non is that pleadings must contain all requisite factual ingredients of a cause of action. This Court is of the view that it is the bounden duty and obligation of every court, while deciding an Order 7 Rule 11 CPC application, to carefully scrutinize the pleadings and the documents on which the pleadings are predicated. The Supreme Court has highlighted the requirement to read the pleadings meaningfully in view of the relied upon documents and see that the same are not illusionary or vexatious. The Apex Court in T. Arivandandam Vs. T.V. Satyapal and Another, (1977) 4 SCC 467 has held as under:-

â5. We have not the slightest hesitation in condemning the petitioner for the gross abuse of the process of the court repeatedly and unrepentantly resorted to. From the statement of the facts found in the judgment of the High Court, it is perfectly plain that the suit now pending before the First Munsif's Court, Bangalore, is a flagrant misuse of the mercies of the law in receiving plaints. The learned Munsif must remember that if on a meaningful -- not formal -- reading of the plaint it is manifestly vexatious, and meritless, in the sense of not disclosing a clear right to sue, he should exercise his power under Order 7, Rule 11 CPC taking care to see that the ground mentioned therein is fulfilled. And, if clever drafting has created the illusion of a cause of action, nip it in the bud at the first hearing by examining the party searchingly under Order 10, CPC. An activist Judge is the answer to irresponsible law suits. The trial courts would insist imperatively on examining the party at the first hearing so that bogus litigation can be shot down at the earliest stage. The Penal Code is also resourceful enough to meet such men, (Cr. XI) and must be triggered against them. In this case, the learned Judge to his cost realised what George Bernard Shaw remarked on the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi:
âIt is dangerous to be too good.â (emphasis supplied)
38. The Supreme Court in I.T.C. Limited Vs. Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunal and Others, (1998) 2 SCC 70 has held as under:-
â16. The question is whether a real cause of action has been set out in the plaint or something purely illusory has been stated with a view to get out of Order 7 Rule 11 CPC. Clever drafting creating illusions of cause of action are not permitted in law and a clear right to sue should be shown in the plaint. (See T. Arivandandam v. T.V. Satyapal[(1977) 4 SCC 467] .) xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
27. As stated above, non-movement of goods by the seller could be due to a variety of tenable or untenable reasons, the seller may be in breach of the contract but that by itself does not permit a plaintiff to use the word âfraudâ in the plaint and get over any objections that may be raised by way of filing an application under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC. As pointed out by Krishna Iyer, J. in T. Arivandandam case [(1977) 4 SCC 467], the ritual of repeating a word or creation of an illusion in the plaint can certainly be unravelled and exposed by the Court while dealing with an application under Order 7 Rule 11(a). Inasmuch as the mere allegation of drawal of monies without movement of goods does not amount to a cause of action based on âfraudâ, the Bank cannot take shelter under the words âfraudâ or âmisrepresentationâ used in the plaint.â (emphasis supplied)
39. Even, in Kamala & Ors. Vs. K.T. Eshwara Sa & Ors. (supra) as well as Ms. Ilaria Kapur Vs. Sh. Rakesh Kapur & Ors. (supra) it has been held that a plaint can be rejected under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC if the averments made in the plaint on their face disclose no cause of action and/or if the same disclose a cause of action, the same is barred by any law. In the judgments cited by learned senior counsel for the plaintiffs, the earlier Supreme Court judgments in T. Arivandandam Vs. T.V. Satyapal and Another (supra) and I.T.C. Limited Vs. Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunal and Others (supra) have neither been set aside nor dissented or distinguished.
ORDER 6 RULE 4 CPC IS ATTRACTED TO SUITS WHERE THE PLAINTIFF CLAIMS THAT A COPARCENARY OR HUF EXISTS, AS AFTER COMING INTO FORCE OF THE HINDU SUCCESSION ACT, 1956, THERE IS NO PRESUMPTION AS TO THE EXISTENCE OF AN HUF.

40. A learned Single Judge of this Court in the case of Surender Kumar Vs. Dhani Ram & Ors. 227 (2016) DLT 217 has held that Order 6 Rule 4 CPC is attracted to suits where the plaintiff claims that a coparcenary or HUF exists, as after coming into force of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as 'Act, 1956'), there is no presumption as to the existence of an HUF. Consequently, detailed facts have to be averred. The averments have to be made by factual references qua each property claimed to be an HUF property as to how the same is an HUF property. The relevant portion of the said judgment is reproduced hereinbelow:-

â9. I would like to further note that it is not enough to aver a mantra, so to say, in the plaint simply that a joint Hindu family or HUF exists. Detailed facts as required by Order 6 Rule 4, CPC as to when and how the HUF properties have become HUF properties must be clearly and categorically averred. Such averments have to be made by factual references qua each property claimed to be an HUF property as to how the same is an HUF property, and, in law generally bringing in any and every property as HUF property is incorrect as there is known tendency of litigants to include unnecessarily many properties as HUF properties, and which is done for less than honest motives. Whereas prior to passing of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 there was a presumption as to the existence of an HUF and its properties, but after passing of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 in view of the ratios of the judgments of the Supreme Court in the cases of Chander Sen (supra) and Yudhister (supra), there is no such presumption that inheritance of ancestral property creates an HUF, and therefore, in such a post 1956 scenario a mere ipse dixit statement in the plaint that an HUF and its properties exist is not a sufficient compliance of the legal requirement of creation or existence of HUF properties inasmuch as it is necessary for existence of an HUF and its properties that it must be specifically, stated that as to whether the HUF came into existence before 1956 or after 1956 and if so how and in what manner giving all requisite factual details. It is only in such circumstances where specific facts are mentioned to clearly plead a cause of action of existence of an HUF and its properties, can a suit then be filed and maintained by a person claiming to be a coparcener for partition of the HUF properties.""
(emphasis supplied)
41. A Division Bench of this Court in Sagar Gambhir Vs. Sukhdev Singh Gambhir and Ors., 241 (2017) DLT 98 has endorsed the said view.
The relevant portion of the Division Bench's judgment is reproduced hereinbelow:-

â5. The defendants filed IA No. 1325/2012 invoking Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure pleading that the averments in the plaint did not disclose a cause of action.
6. Vide impugned order dated May 06, 2016, relying upon the decision of the Supreme Court reported as (1987) 1 SCC 204Yudhihster v. Ashok Kumar, and two decisions of this Court reported as 225 (2015) DLT 211 Sunny (Minor) v. Sh. Raj Singh and 227 (2016) DLT 217 Surinder Kumar v. Dhani Ram the learned Single Judge has held that the pleadings were illusory and did not disclose a cause of action. The suit has been dismissed, and we treat this to be a misnomer for the reason if a plaint does not disclose a cause of action it has to be rejected. Qua challenge to the will, the learned Single Judge has held that this would be a separate cause of action and a separate suit could be filed.
11. .......the Supreme Court laid emphasis that Courts must accord due attention to the pleadings, and in civil cases pertaining to property, must accord the necessary consideration to the admitted documents filed by the parties and highlighted that this care would prevent many a false claims from sailing beyond the stage of issues. In paragraph 73 to 79 of the opinion, the Supreme Court highlighted that suspicious pleadings, incomplete pleadings and pleadings not supported by documents would not even warrant issues to be settled. Thus, the said observations of the Supreme Court would be very relevant in the instant case.
15. The pleadings by the appellant is only to the effect that the property at Rajinder Nagar was purchased by the grandfather of the appellant from out of the funds of the firm M/s. Gian Singh Sukhdev Singh which was set up by the late grandfather of the appellant and that the funds for the business came from the properties left behind in Pakistan. No details or particulars of the properties left behind at Pakistan have been pleaded. We take judicial notice of the fact that post-partition, people who migrated to India from the territories of the newly State of Pakistan were required to file claims before the custodian of evacuee properties and upon proof of properties left behind in Pakistan, compensations were assessed. These people were treated as refugees and either money or an immovable property was allotted to these refugees by the Ministry of Rehabilitation, Government of India. In the plaint the lack of pleadings to said effect cannot be overlooked. There is thus a bald assertion without any material particulars regarding the firm M/s. Gian Singh Sukhdev Singh being set up by the great grandfather of the appellant. The appellant has himself filed documents, and one of which is an income-tax assessment order for the Assessment Year 1957-58 concerning the income-tax return of the defendant No.
1. The same shows that the business of M/s. Gian Singh Sukhdev Singh was the sole proprietary business of defendant No. 1 and the source of funds to acquire the property in Rajinder Nagar was from the income generated from the firm. This document being filed by the appellant could be looked into by the learned Single Judge and the only error in the impugned order would be one of narrative of fact wherein said document has been referred to as relied upon by the defendants. It is a case where the appellant as well as the defendants relied upon the documents.""
(emphasis supplied) THERE EXISTS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN A COPARCENARY PROPERTY AND A HINDU JOINT FAMILY PROPERTY.
42. A Mitakshara coparcenary is a body of individuals having been created by law, unlike a joint family which can be constituted by an agreement of parties. The Supreme Court in Hardeo Rai Vs. Sakuntala Devi and Others, (2008) 7 SCC 46 has held as under:-

â19. We may at the outset notice the characteristics of a Mitakshara coparcenary from the decision of this Court whereupon Mr Rai has placed strong reliance being SBI v. Ghamandi Ram [(1969) 2 SCC 33 : AIR 1969 SC 1330]. Therein this Court was concerned with a notification issued by the Government of Pakistan in terms of Section 45 of the Pakistan (Administration of Evacuee Property) Ordinance, 1949. We may, however, notice the dicta laid down therein: (Ghamandi Ram case [(1969) 2 SCC 33 : AIR 1969 SC 1330] , SCC pp. 36- 37, para 5) â5. According to the Mitakshara School of Hindu Law all the property of a Hindu joint family is held in collective ownership by all the coparceners in a quasi-corporate capacity. The textual authority of the Mitakshara lays down in express terms that the joint family property is held in trust for the joint family members then living and thereafter to be born (see Mitakshara, Chapter I, pp. 1-27). The incidents of coparcenership under the Mitakshara Law are: first, the lineal male descendants of a person up to the third generation, acquire on birth ownership in the ancestral properties of such person; secondly, that such descendants can at any time work out their rights by asking for partition; thirdly, that till partition each member has got ownership extending over the entire property conjointly with the rest; fourthly, that as a result of such co-ownership the possession and enjoyment of the properties is common;
fifthly, that no alienation of the property is possible unless it be for necessity, without the concurrence of the coparceners, and sixthly, that the interest of a deceased member lapses on his death to the survivors. A coparcenary under the Mitakshara School is a creature of law and cannot arise by act of parties except insofar that on adoption the adopted son becomes a coparcener with his adoptive father as regards the ancestral properties of the latter.â (emphasis supplied) THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PARTNERSHIP AND HINDU JOINT FAMILY FIRM.

43. There is also a difference between partnership and Hindu Joint Family firm. Mulla in his Treatise Hindu Law 21 st Edition has pointed out the following points of difference between partnership and Hindu Joint Family firm:-

âIn a joint family business no member of the family can say that he is the owner of one-half, one-third or one-forth. The essence of joint Hindu family property is unity of ownership and community of interest and the shares of the members are not definedâ.
44. The Supreme Court in Nanchand Gangaram Shetji Vs. Mallappa Mahalingappa Sadalge & Ors.; (1976) 2 SCC 429 has held as under:-

â37.......In a joint Hindu family business, no member of the family can say that he is the owner of one-half, one-third or one- fourth. The essence of joint Hindu family property is unity of ownership and community of interest, and the shares of the members are not defined. Similarly, the pattern of the accounts of a joint Hindu family business maintained by the karta is different from those of a partnership. In the case of the former the shares of the individual members in the profits and losses are not worked out, while they have to be worked out in the case of partnership accounts.â (emphasis supplied)
45. Consequently, a partnership property cannot be a Hindu Joint Family Property.

THERE IS NO PRESUMPTION THAT A BUSINESS STANDING IN THE NAME OF ANY MEMBER OF THE JOINT FAMILY IS A JOINT FAMILY BUSINESS.

46. It is also settled law that there is no presumption that a business standing in the name of any member of the joint family is a joint family business. The Supreme Court in P.S.Sairam & Anr. Vs. P.S.Rama Rao Pissey & Ors. (2004) 11 SCC 320 has held as under:-

â7. Crucial question in the present appeal is as to whether business which was conducted by defendant No.1 was his separate business or it belonged to joint family, consisting of himself and his sons. It is well settled that so far as immovable property is concerned, in case the same stands in the name of individual member, there would be a presumption that the same belongs to joint family, provided it is proved that the joint family had sufficient nucleus at the time of its acquisition, but no such presumption can be applied to business. Reference in this connection may be made to a decision of this Court in the case of G.Narayana Raju v.G.Chamaraju:AIR 1968 SC 1276 wherein in a suit for partition defence was taken that business of Ambika Stores was separate business of defendant as the business did not grow out of joint family funds or at least by efforts of members of joint family which was accepted by the trial court as well as the High Court. When the matter was brought to this Court in appeal, upholding the judgment of the High Court, the Court observed thus at page 466:- (AIR p. 1278, para 3) ""It is well established that there is no presumption under Hindu Law that a business standing in the name of any member of the joint family is a joint family business even if that member is the manager of the joint family. Unless it could be shown that the business in the hands of the coparcener grew up with the assistance of the joint family property or joint family funds or that the earnings of the business were blended with the joint family estate, the business remains free and separate.""
(emphasis supplied)
47. There are observations to the same effect in G. Narayana Raju (Dead) By His Legal Representative Vs. G. Chamaraju and Others, AIR 1968 SC 1276 and Bhuru Mal Vs. Jagannath and Others, AIR 1942 PC 13.
THERE IS A PRESUMPTION THAT EVERY HINDU FAMILY WHICH IS JOINT IN FOOD AND WORSHIP IS A HINDU JOINT FAMILY; BUT THERE IS NO PRESUMPTION THAT THE ESTATE IS JOINT OR THE PROPERTY IS THE HINDU JOINT FAMILY PROPERTY. THE PARTY WHO ASSERTS THAT THE PROPERTY IS HINDU JOINT FAMILY PROPERTY HAS TO PROVE IT.

48. In the opinion of this Court, there is a presumption that every Hindu Family which is joint in food and worship is a Joint Family; but there is no presumption that the Estate is joint or that the properties of the family members belong to the Hindu Joint Family. The party who asserts that the property is joint family property has to prove it.

49. Mulla in his Treatise Hindu Law states as under:-

""Para 231- Mulla's Hindu Law - 21st Edition
1) Presumption that a joint family continues joint - Generally speaking, 'the normal state of every Hindu family is joint. Presumably every such family is joint in food, worship and estate.' In the absence of proof of division, such is the legal presumption.
2) No presumption that a joint family possesses joint property
- There is no presumption that a family, because it is joint, possesses joint property or any property. When in a suit for partition, a party claims that any particular item of the property is joint family property, or when in a suit for a mortgage, a party contends that the property mortgaged is joint family property, the burden of proving it rests on the party asserting it.""
(emphasis supplied)
50. In Makhan Singh (Dead) By LRs. Vs. Kulwant Singh, (2007) 10 SCC 602, the Apex Court has held as under:-
""7. ......In this connection the judgment in D.S. Lakshmaiah case becomes relevant. It had been observed that a property could not be presumed to be a joint Hindu family property merely because of the existence of a joint Hindu family and raised an ancillary question in the following terms: (SCC p. 314, para 7) â7. The question to be determined in the present case is as to who is required to prove the nature of property whether it is joint Hindu family property or self-acquired property of the first appellant.â",fm
"enant has created nuisance), 12(1)(f) (for bona fide requirement of landlord for non-residential purposes) and 12(1)(g) (bona fide requirements of landlord to carry out repairs) of the M.P. Accommodation Control Act, 1961. The relevant parts of section 12 of the Act are set out as under: ""12. Restriction on eviction of tenants.-- (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other law or contract, no suit shall be filed in any civil court against a tenant for his eviction from any accommodation except on one or more of the following grounds, only, namely-- 3 (a) - (b) x x x (c) that the tenant or any person residing with him has created a nuisance or has done any act which is inconsistent with the purpose for which he was admitted to the tenancy of the accommodation, or which is likely to affect adversely and substantially the interest of the landlord therein: (d) - (e) x x x (f) that the accommodation let for non-residential purpose is required bona fide by the landlord for the purpose of continuing or starting his business or that of any of his major sons or unmarried daughters if he is the owner thereof or for any person for whose benefit the accommodation is held and that the landlord or such person has no other reasonably suitable non-

.. 25 .. NMS166.13.sxw residential accommodation of his own in his occupation in the city or town concerned; (g) that the accommodation has become unsafe, or unfit for human habitation and is required bona fide by the landlord for carrying out repairs which cannot be carried out without the accommodation being vacated.""

5. In the written statement filed in the trial court, the respondents herein raised the main objection that the appellants herein are not the owners of the suit property and the trial court had no jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter as the suit property has been a Wakf property. It may be pertinent to mention that in the written statement the respondents nowhere took the plea that the suit property, namely `Madras Hotel' is a joint family property. The trial court held that the appellants were in bona fide need of carrying on the business of sweets and for running a restaurant. No other vacant property was in possession of the appellants in Jabalpur. It was also held that the shop in question is very old, unsafe and in dilapidated condition. There is need to repair and carry out some structural changes in the shop which cannot be carried out unless the same is made available to the appellants. The trial court clearly held that the appellants are in bona fide need of the suit property. The trial court also held that the respondents have not paid rent since September, 1992 and decided the issue of default in favour of the appellants. The trial court categorically held that the suit property is not the Wakf property and decreed the suit of the appellants.

8. The High Court in the impugned judgment, without any pleadings or basis, held that the property namely `Madras Hotel' is a joint family property. The High Court erroneously observed that the property namely `Madras Hotel' was purchased by the father of the appellants and his brothers, whereas in fact the property was purchased by the appellants vide sale deed dated 31.12.1991. The assumption of wrong fact has led to total erroneous finding and conclusion. The High Court in para 8 observed as under: ""......It is firmly established that the building known as `Madras Hotel' belongs to Laxminarayan Pal and his two sons who are the plaintiffs. That is their joint family property. This building was purchased by Laxminarayan when he was carrying on business with his two brothers and the partition took place long after the acquisition of that building. In that partition that building was allotted to Laxminarayan .. 26 .. NMS166.13.sxw alone......""

12. The appellants further relied on Mudi Gowda Gowdappa Sankh v. Ram Chandra Ravagowda Sankh (1969) 1 SCC 386 wherein this Court held that, of course, there is no presumption that merely because the family is joint so the property is also joint. So the person alleging the property to be joint family property must prove it.

In that case, this Court further held that the burden of proving that any particular property is joint family property is, therefore, in the first instance, upon the person who claims it to be coparcenary property. But if the possession of a nucleus of the joint family property is either admitted or proved, any acquisition made by a member of the joint family is presumed to be joint family property. The Court carved out an exception and observed that, ""this is, however, subject to the limitation that the joint family property must be such as with its aid the property in question could have been acquired. It is only after the possession of an adequate nucleus is shown, that the onus shifts on to the person who claims the property as self- acquisition to affirmatively make out that the property was acquired without any aid from the family estate."" In Mudi Gowda Gowdappa Sankh (supra), this court heavily relied upon the ratio of Privy Council judgment in Randhi Appalaswami v. Randhi Suryanarayanamurti & Others ILR 1948 Mad 440 wherein the legal position of Hindu Law has been beautifully articulated by Sir John Beaumont. The relevant portion of the judgment is reproduced as under: ""Proof of the existence of a joint family does not lead to the presumption that property held by any member of the family is joint, and the burden rests upon anyone asserting that any item of property was joint to establish the fact. But where it is established that the family possessed some joint property which from its nature and relative value may have formed the nucleus from which the property in question may have been acquired, the burden shifts to the party alleging self-acquisition to establish affirmatively that the property was acquired without the aid of the joint family property.""

SUBMISSION OF MR P. K. DHAKEPHALKAR, LEARNED SENIOR COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT NO.3 .. 27 .. NMS166.13.sxw

6. Mr Dhakephalkar, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of defendant No.3 one of the brother of the plaintiff supported the case of the plaintiff and submits that the presumption of joint family business exists.

Learned senior counsel submits that there is no proof of separation of the family and/or business. Various firms and companies were formed by family members for various reasons. Forming of various firms and companies for the purpose of carrying on business does mot mean that there was separation of family members. Mr Dhakephalkar also placed reliance on para 5 of the Affidavit in reply filed by defendant No.1 in support of his submission that defendant No.1 had admitted in the said para that out of the income generated from M/s Kanayalal Rameshkumar, the first defendant started other businesses. Mr Dhakephalkar placed reliance on the Judgment of this Court in case of Kausabai wd/o Rajaram Waradkar & Ors. Vs. Gayabai wd/o Gundaji Mogre & ors. Reported in (2010) (4) Mh.L.J. 46 in support of his submission that a distinction has to be made between joint family property and the property acquired by joint efforts. Even if one of the coparceners decides to break away from the rest of the family other coparceners still can constitute a joint Hindu family. Learned senior counsel also submits that if the business was joint and the property was acquired from earnings of joint business, it must be presumed that each of the members has .. 28 .. NMS166.13.sxw his equal share unless otherwise shown. Learned senior counsel submits that defendants have failed to show that any of the properties which are subject matter of this suit, were self-acquired property. Paras 8 to 10 of the said Judgment read thus :

""8. Thus, they contend that they constitute a joint Hindu family. In fact, law presumes that every Hindu family is a joint family unless otherwise shown. In the instant case, however, the controversy seems to have arisen because the father does not live with the family. Normally, a joint family consists of father, mother and sons and their wives. Here, admittedly, father had long back turned the plaintiffs and defendant No.2 out of the house and he is living separately. The question is whether the mother and two sons could constitute a joint family and that seems to be the question of law raised. I see no reason why they cannot. If two brothers, upon death of father, can constitute a joint family, there is no reason why two brothers in this case with their mother cannot constitute a joint family, when father deserts them. Even if one of the coparceners decides to break away from the rest of the family, the other coparceners can constitute a joint family. Even otherwise, in the instant case father had deserted them, he has not separated as such from the family. I find that the two sons with their mother and even wives can constitute the joint Hindu family. In the instant case, it could be said that the plaintiffs and defendant no.2 constituted a joint Hindu family.
9. The plaintiffs' case is that plaintiffs and defendant no.2 were turned out of the house. If the pleadings in the plaint are seen,it could be gathered that the plaintiffs do not plead that family possesses any ancestral property at all. It is not even their case that the father had given anything to them from any ancestral property. There is, therefore, no pleading of the plaintiff's that any kind of nucleus was available for blending the suit property, in order that any property possessed or owned by the should become the joint family property.
                 There     has   to   be   some   nucleus   available   from   which   that  





                                      .. 29 ..                             NMS166.13.sxw


property could be purchased. Since in this case the plaintiffs did not possess any ancestral income giving property, it could not be said that the suit house was a joint family property as such.
10.The distinction has to be made between joint family property and the property acquired by joint efforts. The suit property could in no case be treated as joint family property. It is to be seen if it is a jointly acquired property or not. Defendants contend that defendant no.2 was alone running his own business, while plaintiff claims that the business run was family business and from its income the property is acquired.
From the evidence on record, the suit property could certainly be said to be the jointly acquired property. It is the case of the plaintiffs that plaintiff no.1 started the business and started earning. DW 1 Vitthal admits in the cross examination that his mother was dealing in grains and was earning. He also admits that his mother and aunt paid him money for starting business. If mother was also doing the business, as is accepted by the defendants, it is difficult to accept the theory of defendant no.2 that he was alone running the shop. Admittedly, there were two shops at two different places. It is therefore, difficult to accept that defendant No.2 alone could run both the shops at the two different places. The theory of the plaintiffs that the shops were joint and run by all has, therefore, to be accepted. There is another strong reason why the property has to be teated as joint ly acquired property. Defendant No.1 had filed the suit against defendant No.2 and plaintiff No.1 in respect of recovery of rent of shop of plaintiffs and defendant No.2. The certified copy of the plaint in that suit is Exh.36. In plaint para No.2, following averments are made.
"" Defendant No.2 is the mother of defendant No.1 and they constitute joint family. Defendants carry on retail grocery business."".
These contents are admitted in the written statement filed at Exh.37. Obviously, defendant No.2 admitted in that suit that the shop was a joint family business. Even in para 17 of the said written statement there is a clear averment that defendants were running the shop and house was reconstructed by the defendants. DW 1 Vitthal in cross-examination admits that he had filed such a written .. 30 .. NMS166.13.sxw statement and that he had stated therein that house belonged to joint family. With this evidence, I do no think that any more evidence is required to conclude that the business was joint and the property was purchased from that business income. If the business was joint and the property is acquired from earning of joint business, it must be assumed that each of the members has an equal share in it unless otherwise shown.
This takes me to the next substantial question of law i.e. Whether the appellant could be treated as a bona fide purchaser. Bona fide purchaser is that person who takes reasonable care to ascertain that the transferor had the power to make transfer and he had acted in good faith and also that the true owner had consented to such transfer. Since true owners are challenging the transfer, there is no question of consent. Let us see if there is evidence of appellant's acting in good faith and whether he had taken reasonable care. I find that this is a fit case of lack of good faith and not even a reasonable case has been taken. It appears, on the other hand, that defendant no.1 entered into contract of purchase of the property with open eyes. The reason for saying so is that the appellant does not enter into witness box to make out the case in pleasing and second in his own plaint vide Exh.36, he had made an averment and assertion that the shop and the property belonged to the joint family. This clearly shows that defendant no.1 has had full knowledge of the property being owned by the family and not by defendant no.2 alone. The appellant therefore, could not be treated to be a bonafide purchaser. Although I find that the property is not a joint family property as such, all the same it is jointly acquired property in which each one of them has equal share. In the circumstances, there is no difficulty in confirming the judgment and decree as passed by the court below. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed. No order as to costs.""
7. Mr. Dhakephalkar, learned senior counsel also placed reliance upon Supreme Court Judgment in case of Madanlal (dead) by LRS. And Ors. v. Yoga Bai (dead) by LRS. reported in 2003(5) Supreme Court Cases 59 in support of his submission that running of various separate firms and .. 31 .. NMS166.13.sxw companies would not necessarily imply separation. Paras 5 & 6 of the said Judgment read thus :

""5. The High Court has not believed the case of the defendants that there had already been a settlement in respect of the properties in question in 1942. It at least indicates that even according to the contesting defendants, some settlement of the property amongst the members of the family was necessary which had already taken place earlier i.e. to say existence of joint property cannot be denied. Once their case of settlement in respect of the same property having taken place earlier has been dis-believed, there remain hardly any ground to resist the claim of the plaintiff for partition and 1/5th share in the properties. The case of the defendant that after the settlement the brothers have been residing separately and they have been carrying on their business separately, hence there remained nothing which was joint amongst the members of the family which could be partitioned is rightly held to be untenable.
6. We find that after appreciation of the evidence the High Court has arrived at a finding that no such settlement had taken place in 1942. Learned counsel for the appellant has vehemently urged that Exhibit B-3 is the deed of settlement which should have been given due weight by the High Court while considering the evidence. He has also submitted that the High Court has not taken into account documentary evidence placed on record, namely Exhibits B-2, B-3, B-4, B-5, B-6 etc. as well as Ex.B-15 and B-16. He has also placed reliance upon the decision in Surinder Singh v. Hardial Singh and Ors. MANU/SC/0166/1984 : [1985]1SCR1059 to the effect that findings of fact recorded, ignoring the documentary evidence on record is vitiated. We find that the High Court has considered a number of documents on record except a few which may not have been considered necessary to be referred to in the judgment. The High Court has taken a note of Ex.B-3, the alleged deed of settlement executed by Purandas in 1957 and has dealt with it in detail. Referring to the statement of DW-1, the High Court has taken a note of the fact that according to him B-3 came into existence since the Government was demanding inspection of their account books. DW-1 also could not indicate the order of handing over the shop to him by Purandas prior to 1972. The settlement was said to be in .. 32 .. NMS166.13.sxw 1942 and deed is executed in 1957. Taking the evidence on record as a whole the case of the defendant of settlement of properties in 1942 and the deed executed in 1957 have not been believed. We find no good reason to interfere with that finding of fact which is supported by evidence and cogent reasons. In so far the other documents, which according to the appellant have not been considered, they are some partnership deeds which have been entered into between different members of the family in different combinations. It is sought to be established that they have been running their business separately under different partnership. We feel that no such inference can be drawn. In a family which carries on a number of business, it is quite often that it is carried out under different names and styles and often constitutes different companies or partnerships for better handling of business or to keep it manageable or for various other reasons. It is no proof of separation nor are the letters which are sought to be relied upon, written to the income-tax authorities and the assessment orders passed by the income-tax authorities. It has already come in evidence that even B-3 came into existence since the government wanted to inspect the account books. Therefore, once the settlement before the suit for partition was filed is not accepted by means of a finding of fact recorded by the High Court, the case of the defendant falls through.""
8. Mr Dhakephalkar, learned senior counsel submits that the third defendant is also entitled to 1/10 th share in the properties and business described in Exhibit-D & C, defendant No.3 being a member of the joint family.

9. Defendant No.6 has filed separate affidavit supporting the case of the plaintiff and adopts the arguments advanced by the plaintiff and defendant No.3.

.. 33 .. NMS166.13.sxw SUBMISSION OF MR ASPI CHINOY, LEARNED SENIOR COUNSEL ON BEHALF OF DEFENDANT NO.1 :

10. Mr Chinoy, learned senior counsel submitted that defendant No.1 at the age of 17 started business as a broker in spices and earned profits. It is submitted that in the year 1969, firm of M/s Moolchand and Co. in which father was partner, had stopped business as it had suffered large losses.

Father had liabilities of Rs.25 lacs and did not carry on any other business. In 1969, the firm M/s Kanayalal Rameshkumar was started in partnership with M/s Kanayalal Lokram and others. Defendant No.1 introduced in the said firm the amounts he had earned from his brokerage business. Defendant No.1 was the eldest and the only earning member also introduced/admitted the plaintiff and defendant Nos.2 to 4 who were then minors to the benefits of the partnership. Father of the plaintiff and defendant Nos.1 to 8 along with other two partners of M/s Mulchand & Co. filed a petition in 1973 for declaring father and few others as insolvent in this Court. Mr Chinoy, learned senior counsel invited my attention to the statement of father recorded in the said insolvency proceedings. Father admitted in his statement that he had liability of Rs.25,80,000/- to 17 creditors. It was also admitted that since 1969 he had not carried on any other business and had not invested any money with any firm or relations and did not have any .. 34 .. NMS166.13.sxw private investments. He also admitted that he had not entered into any contract under which he had to receive any benefit. By an order dated 9 th October 1973, this Court declared father of the plaintiff and defendant Nos.1 to 8 as 'insolvent'. It is submitted that for purchase of flat in Jolly Maker Apartmentr in 1976, defendant Nos.1 to 4 had pulled their own funds which flat was sold in 1982 and four separate flats at Andheri were purchased by defendant Nos.1 to 4 out of the sale proceeds of flat in Jolly Maker Apartment. Mr Chinoy submits that in 1982 defendant No.1 formed his sole property concern viz. Gautam Overseas for trading in dry-fruits and spices. Since 1985, defendant Nos.2,3 and 4 exited and the plaintiff has in effect been running the partnership firm of M/s Rameshkumar Gopaldas and the profits and funds have been distributed on between the plaintiff and defendant No.1 and nobody else. Defendant No.2 started his own independent business in the year 1985. Defendant Nos.3 and 4 started business in the name and style of Bhagwandas & Sons in 1985. Plaintiff purchased a flat at Versova Woodlands in the year 1985 out of his own funds.

Defendant No.1 started his first construction venture M/s United Development Agency with outside partners in 1985. Plaintiff started doing business as a sole proprietor of M/s Ahuja Traders which carried on the business of trading in dry fruits and spices in 1986. Defendant No.1 entered .. 35 .. NMS166.13.sxw into partnership with certain outsiders in the firm viz. CAMS constructions in the year 1988 and carried on the business of construction contractors. In 1989, first defendant entered into partnership firm with certain non-family members in the name and style of CAMs Developers and carried on the business of construction contractors. In 1989, the first defendant entered into partnership with eight other partners in the name and style of CAMS India Corporation which included the plaintiff and certain non family member. Mr Chinoy submits that as far as mortgage of flat No.601-B standing in the name of plaintiff is concerned, the said flat was given as security in favour of State Bank of India for securing the loan given to CAMS Developers. At the request of the first defendant, plaintiff being a partner of CAMS India Corporation, plaintiff mortgaged his flat. It is submitted that in 1990, plaintiff started carrying on construction business in the name and style of Mahavir Constructions with certain outsiders and non family members. In 1991 defendant No.1 and plaintiff started partnership business in the name and style of Ahuja Constructions.

11. During the period between 1991 to 2003, the plaintiff and his wife have been partners and shareholder in diverse partnership firms and companies set up by first defendant to undertake business initially as construction contractors and later as developers. Plaintiff and his wife hold .. 36 .. NMS166.13.sxw shares in different companies. Mr Chinoy submits that other family members i.e. defendant Nos.2 to 8 were not involved in any of these firms and companies and had never made any claims to the business, assets, profits or funds thereof. The profits and assets of any of the firm or company were never shared with or distributed to defendant Nos.2 to 8. Plaintiff and his wife were given shares details whereof are forming part of record in various companies in this proceedings. Mr Chinoy submits that in the year 2001, the real estate market had collapsed and contracting jobs had come to a standstill. The partnership firms of the businesses of the first defendant had accumulated losses of Rs.35 crores. Plaintiff wanted to exit from the business and wanted to ensure that he would not be exposed to such large liabilities and that the assets he had offered as security for such firms/businesses were released. Accordingly during the period 2001-2003, the first defendant proceeded to convert the said partnership firms into private limited companies under Part IX of the Companies Act and the erstwhile partners were allotted shares in the new companies in proportion to their capital ratios in the firms resulting in the liability of the plaintiff and the other partners becoming restricted to their shareholding. The said companies thereafter raised capital by increasing their shareholding. The plaintiff did not subscribe to such additional shares. Plaintiff was fully aware of such .. 37 .. NMS166.13.sxw additional shares being offered/issued and did not invest additional amounts in purchasing the shares. Mr Chinoy submits that to finance the project defendant No.16 Company gave 49% equity to Citi Properties (a Division of Citi Bank) for Rs.198 Crs and took a loan of Rs.225 Crs. It is stated that Rs.195 Crs had been disbursed from ICICI Bank. Presently there are liabilities of Rs.635 Crs in respect of the said project. There are borrowings of Rs.270 Crs in other projects and losses of Rs.135 Crs in defendant No.17 Company.

Mr Chinoy submits that for the first time by letter dated 28 th January 2008, plaintiff through Advocate sought inspection of various documents and registers of defendant No.17 Company. Since loan taken by Keepsade Private Limited from Cosmos Bank was repaid, flat of the plaintiff on the 12 th floor at Soona Villa was released in the month of November 2011.

12. Mr Chinoy, learned senior counsel submits that merely because two brothers were partners in various businesses would not mean that it would be a family business. No other members participated in the business.

There was no family contribution in any of the businesses which are claimed as joint family business. Since 1970, parties were not residing together and were separate. Since 1984, apart from plaintiff, no other family members have been participating in Kirana shop or construction firm. There is no plea of the plaintiff that since 1984, any distribution of the property in any of the .. 38 .. NMS166.13.sxw business had taken place amongst the family members. There is also no plea of the plaintiff that any other family members other than partners in such business were given any share and/or demanded by such family member. It is submitted that there is neither joint family nor any joint participation or issuing of profit or liability between the plaintiff and defendant Nos.1 to 8.

Mr Chinoy submits that since father had no income of any nature whatsoever and had no investments and had not started any business as admitted by father himself in his statement recorded in insolvency proceedings since 1969 and had suffered a huge loss, there was no question of the father investing any amount or starting any business in the name of family members in the year 1969 or thereafter. It is submitted that the plaintiff has failed to prove any nucleus. Defendant Nos.1 to 4 had purchased flats from the funds out of profit distributed to each partner. Plaintiff also had purchased a flat at Versova out of his own funds. Except defendant Nos.2 and 6, other family members have filed affidavit admitting that there was no joint family business as claimed by the plaintiff. Mr Chinoy invited my attention to affidavit in reply of defendant No.1 in which it was pleaded that the shares were issued in various companies in which plaintiff had shares at material times and was offered such shares but plaintiff chose not to invest any further amounts in the said companies. Mr Chinoy also invited my attention to re-joinder filed .. 39 .. NMS166.13.sxw by the plaintiff to the reply dated 5 th July 2013 to demonstrate that the said averment made in the affidavit and in particular para 17 which was not denied by the plaintiff in rejoinder. Plaintiff had signed balance-sheet of the companies and was aware of the increase in share capital. Mr Chinoy submits that it is not the case of the plaintiff that he represents other 8/10 th share.

There is neither such pleading nor any prayer in the plaint. It is submitted that in 1976, there was split of four defendants. There is separate residence, separate kitchen and business. Mr Chinoy submits that if there is any independent agreement of any shareholder including the plaintiff in the business arrived between in any of the companies, who were parties to the proceedings, plaintiff would have independent cause of action. Mr Chinoy submits that during the period 2003- 2010, plaintiff got his personal properties given by him in security which are released. Mr Chinoy pointed out that it was not the case of the plaintiff in the pleadings that since 1985, plaintiff and defendant Nos.1 to 8 distributed any profit or had contributed any amount towards any liability of the business of the partnership firm in which they were independent partners and had contributed towards liability of that particular business and were given their respective share as a partner.

Other eight family members have not claimed any share in any of the properties which are subject matter of the suit. It is submitted that onus is on .. 40 .. NMS166.13.sxw the plaintiff to prove nucleous. If family leaves together and worships together, there is general presumption of joint family. It is submitted that independent businesses are never proved otherwise by cogent and clinching evidence. It is submitted that participation in business by labour service, funding and issuing of profit and loss has to be proved. Mr Chinoy, learned senior counsel relied on Judgment of Madras High Court in case of R.

Selvaraj v. R. Radhakrishna reported in AIR 1976 Madras 156 in support of his submission that the contribution of labour, service or money by one member of the joint family to the other should be so conspicuous and impressive that on a prima facie examination of such material, a reasonable and prudent person should gain the impression that the two members were so associated with the common object of exploiting a commercial activity to the advantage of the joint family. It is submitted that there is no presumption that a business conducted by a member of the joint family is a joint family business. The presumption on the other hand has to be contrary. Learned counsel placed reliance on paras 1,2, 6 and 11 of the said judgment which read thus :

1. The unsuccessful plaintiff in O.S. No. 3 of 1968 on the file of the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Nagapattinam, is the appellant. Originally the suit was numbered is O.S. No. 42 of 1967 on the file of the Court of the District Judge, East Thanjavur at Nagapattinam. The suit is one for partition and separate possession of the plaintiff's one-third share in the suit properties and for future .. 41 .. NMS166.13.sxw profits. The plaintiff's case is that his paternal grandfather Rajagopal Pillai started a photo business in 1917 under the name and style of Sri Krishna. Photo Studio. The first defendant is the plaintiff's father and the second defendant is the step-brother of the plaintiff. It is claimed that the first defendant got himself associated with his father in the photo business and both of them ran it as a joint family business. When the grandfather Rajagopal Pillai became old, the first defendant, was in sole charge of the studio and the business and the plaintiff after completing the school course, participated in the same and contributed his labour also. Thus, the family photo business was continued after the death of Rajagopal Pillai in 1965 and considerable properties were acquired from and out of the profits of the business. The plaintiff says that he became an expert in the said business and the grandfather himself till his death was doing the sedentary part of the business. As the joint family had no other business or source of earning except the photo studio, the plaintiff acquired a right by birth in the family activity and the assets secured in exercise of such profession. The family acquired the house in which the studio is at present situate besides agricultural lands of an extent of 6.80 acres in Serukudi village from and out of the business profits. It is claimed that large sums of money have also been deposited by the first defendant in his name in various banks. Soon after the death of the grandfather there were misunderstandings between the plaintiff and the first defendant, who was under the influence of his second wife and by the end of April, 1967 the bickering compelled the plaintiff to demand a division of the joint family properties and allotment of his one-third share to him. The plaintiff also refers to a partition in the family to which he was a party but claims that it is an unstamped and unregistered document and, therefore, would not bind him. As the first defendant refused to effect any proper division of the properties and give his one-third share, though such a demand was made through mediators, he had to file the present action claiming a one-third share in the plaint A to D schedule properties. A schedule properties deal with the materials in the photo studio; B schedule refers to a house in Thiruvarur town. C schedule deals with the agricultural lands and the D schedule refers to a deposit of a sum of Rs. 10,000 made by the first defendant in the Indian Overseas Bank at Thiruvarur.
2. In the first defendant's written statement he admits that .. 42 .. NMS166.13.sxw the plaintiff was living with him till April, 1967. Thereafter the plaintiff was living separately with his wife. It is denied that the photo studio called Sri Krishna Photo Studio is a joint family business and the properties mentioned in the various schedules to the plaint arc joint family properties. Rajagopal Pillai, the grandfather of the plaintiff was a public servant employed as a clerk in the Sub- Registrar's Office in the first instance and later in the railways.",fm
"1. The present revision petition has been preferred by the petitioners against the order dated 23.03.2019 (herein after referred to as the impugned order) passed by Ld. M.M. (Mahila Court)Â­01, SouthÂ­West District, Dwarka Criminal Revision No. 59/2020 D.O.D.: 28.02.2020 Courts, Delhi, whereby, ld. Trial Court has ordered for framing of charge in respect of offences punishable u/s 498A/406/34 IPC against them.

2. Brief facts, as per the complaint dated 28.03.2017 lodged by complainant/respondent no.2 with DCP, CAW Cell, Nanakpura, as are relevant and necessary for deciding the present revision petition are that respondent no.2, namely, Ms.Rekha Verma (hereinafter referred to as the complainant), got married with petitioner no.1 herein, namely, Raj Kumar, (hereinafter referred to as accused no.1) on 28.11.2013 according to Hindu rites, customs and ceremonies. She alleged that on the demand of her husband and his family, her parents gave gold ornaments/stridhan/gifts to them prior to the marriage, at the time of marriage and also after the marriage. She further alleged that after her marriage, her motherÂ­inÂ­law i.e. petitioner no.2 herein (hereinafter referred to as accused no.2), asked her to handover the cash received by her as gift in the marriage and accused no.1 also asked her to handover all the jewellery articles to accused no.2 for keeping in safe custody. The accused no.1 also used to cast false aspersions on her character and used to give beatings to her on petty issues like, talking to neighbours, spending time in bathroom etc.. She also alleged that on 08.10.2014, accused no.1 pressurised her to ask her parents and brothers for gifting him a smart phone on his birthday, which demand was fulfilled by her parents for the sake of her happy married life. After the birth of a girl child on 06.11.2014, the accused persons started treating her very badly as they were expecting a son and not a daughter. On 30.11.2014, the complainant was sent to her parents' home and she was brought back to her matrimonial home only on her great persuasions on 04.03.2015 and during her stay at her parental house during the aforesaid period, all the expenses relating to her and her daughter, were Criminal Revision No. 59/2020 D.O.D.: 28.02.2020 borne by her parents. On 01.02.2016, when she requested accused no.1 to give some money for personal expenses, he stated ""Tum job karo aur apne kharche khud poorey karo"" and when she asked for his ATM card, accused no.1 threw her on the floor. On 12.05.2016, accused no.1 abused her and gave beatings to her on the issue of expenses and accused no.2 encouraged accused no.1 for his said acts. On 23.06.2016, she alongwith her husband i.e. accused no.1 got shifted to a rented accommodation and at that time, all her jewellery articles were kept by her motherÂ­inÂ­law i.e. accused no.2 and by her brotherÂ­inÂ­law by saying that it would not be safe to keep jewellery articles in a rented accommodation. It was further alleged that she was illÂ­treated and was harassed by her husband i.e. accused no.1 to bring money from her parents to enable him to pay back the loans as well as to buy a new car for his younger brother. On 14.01.2017 also, she was beaten up by her husband i.e. accused no.1 and her motherÂ­inÂ­law i.e. accused no.2 encouraged him to continue with the ill treatment with her.

3. On the basis of above said complaint, FIR No.116/2017 came to be registered for offences punishable under Section 498A/406/34 IPC at PS CWC Nanak Pura, New Delhi. After completion of investigation, the petitioners stood chargeÂ­sheeted for the said offences. After hearing arguments on the point of charge, impugned order came to be passed by the Court of ld. MM.

4. The impugned order has been assailed by the petitioners, inter alia, on the grounds that same is not sustainable and tenable on the basis of facts of the case and law on the point in issue and same is based upon conjectures and surmises; ld. MM failed to appreciate the fact that there was no material or Criminal Revision No. 59/2020 D.O.D.: 28.02.2020 any other substance for framing of charge against the petitioners; ld. MM did not exercise its judicial discretion in proper manner; and that, the impugned order has been passed in highly mechanical manner on the basis of false documentary evidence placed on record by the complainant.

5. Ld. counsel for petitioners argued on the lines of grounds of challenge to the impugned order, as noted hereinabove. He argued that soon after the marriage of accused no.l with complainant, they started residing together at H.No.7317, 3rd Floor, Gali No.2, Prem Nagar, Delhi, whereas accused no.2 alongwith her other two sons were residing at 1st & 2nd Floors of H.No.7317, Gali No.2, Prem Nagar, Delhi, as it was the prior condition of the family members of complainant that after the marriage, the complainant alongwith her husband would live separately from other family members. However, the complainant wrongly stated in her complaint that accused no.2 used to reside with them, in order to drag her into this false case. He further argued that accused no.2 i.e. motherÂ­inÂ­law is a senior citizen, who is suffering from various ailments including knee problem and it was not feasible for her to go upstairs to the house of complainant to harass her, which fact has been overlooked by ld. MM while passing the impugned order. He, therefore, urged that the impugned order may be set aside and both the petitioners, more particularly the petitioner no.2, may be discharged in this case.

6. On the other hand, ld. Addl.PP for the State/respondent no.1 repelled the aforesaid submissions made on behalf of petitioners and supported the impugned order by submitting that the impugned order is a well reasoned one and is based upon proper appreciation of facts and the material filed alongwith chargeÂ­sheet. He therefore, urged that the revision petition may be Criminal Revision No. 59/2020 D.O.D.: 28.02.2020 dismissed.

7. Learned counsel for respondent no.2/complainant further argued that there are specific allegations of demand of dowry, harassment and breach of trust against both the petitioners/accused persons. He further argued that minor daughter of accused no.1 and complainant is in the custody of complainant and the said accused is not even paying the interim maintenance awarded in favour of minor child by the Court of law. He, therefore, urged that the present revision petition may be dismissed.

8. I have already heard Sh. Balwan Singh, Advocate on behalf of revisionists/petitioners, Sh. Girish Kumar Manhas, ld. Addl. PP on behalf of respondent no.1/State and Sh. N.K. Bhambri, Advocate for respondent no.2. I have also gone through the entire records including the material available in the Trial Court Record.

9. Before dealing with the rival submissions made on behalf of both the sides, it would be appropriate to discuss the legal position on the issues involved herein.

10. The term 'dowry' has not been defined in Section 498A of IPC, but since this expression has been defined in Section 2 of Dowry Prohibition Act, it is required to be given the same meaning for the purpose of Section 498A IPC. The term 'dowry' has been defined as under:Â­ ""Section 2 of Dowry Prohibition Act defines dowry as under:Â­

2. Definition of 'dowry':Â­ In this Act, ""dowry"" means any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectlyÂ­ Criminal Revision No. 59/2020 D.O.D.: 28.02.2020

(a) by one party to a marriage to the other party to the marriage or

(b) by the parent of either party to a marriage or by any other person, to either party to the marriage or to any other person, at or before (or any time after the marriage) in connection with the marriage of the said parties, but does not include) dower or mehar in the case or persons to whom the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) applies.""

11. A careful analysis of the aboveÂ­referred definition would show that dowry would include property or valuable security which is actually given or which is agreed to be given, in relation to the marriage of person in question. The property or valuable security may be given or may be agreed to be given before marriage or at the time of marriage or at any time after the marriage, so long as it is connected with the marriage. But, there has to be a link between the property given or agreed to be given and the marriage. If at any time before or at the time of or even during marriage, the parents of a woman or any other person related or connected to her agreed to give some cash, valuable security or property to her husband or inÂ­laws after marriage, that would also be covered within the definition of dowry as the agreement or promise in such a case would be attributable to the marriage or proposed marriage and if there is demand for any cash property, valuable security etc. which is promised, but not given, it would constitute demand for dowry.

12. If the husband or any other person related or connected to him, demands something from the girl or her parents or any other person related to or connected with her, saying that the article being demanded by them was expected to be given or ought to have been given in marriage, that also, to my mind, would constitute demand of dowry because even though such an article Criminal Revision No. 59/2020 D.O.D.: 28.02.2020 may not have been agreed or promised to be given by the girl or her family members, it might have been in the contemplation of the boy and/or his family members, on account of the expectation that such an article would be given at the time of marriage. Therefore, such demand would be considered to be a demand in connection with the marriage though made after the marriage has been solemnized.

13. In the matter titled as 'Union of India Vs. Prafulla Kumar Samal' reported at AIR 1977 SC 2018, Hon'ble Apex Court has held that at the stage of framing charge, if there is a strong evidence which leads the Court to think that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence, then it is not open to the Court to see that there is no sufficient ground for proceedings against the accused. The accused cannot be discharged if from the First Information Report or complaint and the statements of the witnesses recorded under Section 161 of the Code and from all other material, a prima facie case is made out against the accused. At the initial stage, the truth, veracity and effect of the evidence which the prosecution proposes to adduce are not to be meticulously judged and the standard of test, proof and judgment which is to be applied finally before finding the accused guilty or otherwise is not exactly to be applied at the stage of framing of a charge. What the Court has to consider at this stage is only the sufficiency of the ground for proceedings against the accused and not whether materials on record are sufficient or adequate for conviction.

14. It may be noted that in the celebrated case of 'R.S Nayak Vs. A.R Antulay', reported at AIR 1984 SC 684, the Hon'ble Supreme Court while examining Sections 227, 239 and 245 of the Code relating to discharge in a Criminal Revision No. 59/2020 D.O.D.: 28.02.2020 trial (1) before a Court of Session, (2) of warrant cases, and (3) of summons cases, has observed that in spite of difference in the language of the three sections, the legal position is that if the trial Court is satisfied that prima facie case is made out, the charge has to be framed.

15. Now adverting back to the facts of the present case. There are specific allegations appearing against both these petitioners in respect of offences U/s 498A/406/34 IPC and those allegations have been duly pointed out on behalf of complainant/respondent no.2, as already noted above in preceding para. There are allegations of mental and physical torture being meted out to the complainant by both these petitioners/accused persons as per allegations appearing in the FIR. If the First Information Report, the statements recorded under Section 161 of the Code, and the other material collected during investigation are judged at the touch stone of the above principles, the necessary conclusion is that there is a ground to presume that both these petitioners have prima facie committed the offences punishable under Section 498Â­A/406/34 IPC. At this stage, the prosecution case cannot be thrown out merely by observing that the averments or the allegations in the complaint/First Information Report are vague and indefinite or are false.

16. In the matter titled as 'Girjashankar Vs. State of M.P' reported at 1988 Cri LR (MP)1, High Court of M.P. has held that 'Cruelty' does not necessarily mean physical chastisement. Section 498Â­A, IPC and Section 113 of the Evidence Act are of wide amplitude. Explanation appended to Section 498Â­A IPC explains as to what cruelty means. It should not be narrowly construed so as to suggest or embrace acts of physical torture alone and it should also be borne in mind in this context that such acts of cruelty are Criminal Revision No. 59/2020 D.O.D.: 28.02.2020 invariably committed within the four wall of a house and naturally, eyeÂ­ witnesses to such incidents are not easily available.

17. No doubt, there is growing tendency on the part of complainant to make all kinds of wild and material allegations against the entire family of husband, but at the same time, it cannot be overlooked that when there are direct and specific allegations against inÂ­laws, it is not permissible to discharge them at that stage and prosecution deserves to be granted an opportunity to prove those allegations by producing its witnesses during trial.

18. In the light of aforesaid discussion, I do not find any illegality or infirmity in the impugned order passed by Ld. MM. Resultantly, the present revision petition is hereby dismissed being devoid of merits.

19. Trial Court record be sent back alongwith copy of this order to the Trial/Successor Court immediately for information.

20. File of revision petition be consigned to Record Room.

Mr. Nikhil Gautam, learned counsel for the petitioners submit- ted that the petitioners have sought a dual relief from this Court, firstly, appointment of the petitioners as lawful guardians of the sub- ject wards and secondly, appointment as guardians in person and of the properties of the subject wards.

GP No. 14/2018 Page No. 8/14

19. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the peti- tioners are entitled persons to apply for orders as guardians of the sub- ject wards, as per Section 8 of the Wards Act and the petitioners have adduced evidence in support of the petition, as per the mandate of the Section 13 of the Wards Act.

20. Mr. N. Gautam, learned counsel for the petitioners further sub- mitted that Section 7 of the Wards Act empowers the district Court to appoint a guardian in respect of the person or property or both of a ward to the satisfaction of the Court, if the same is for the welfare of the ward. The learned counsel further laid emphasis that the petitioner No. 1 is the full blood brother of the father of the subject wards and on account of the subject wards being orphaned, the petitioners as a hus- band and wife have taken a moral, social and conscious decision to not only fend and provide for them but also apply for their lawful guardianship in person and property.

21. The learned counsel for the petitioners further submitted that the appointment of the petitioners as the guardian of person and property of the subject wards would be in their best interest, as the subject wards are orphans and the petitioners have raised them as their own children.

22. Section 7 of the Wards Act, empowers the district Court to ap- point a guardian in respect of the person or property of a minor if the same is required for the welfare of the minor. Section 29 of the Wards Act places certain restrictions on the guardian so appointed to deal with the property of the minor, except with the permission of the GP No. 14/2018 Page No. 9/14 Court. Specifically, clause (a) of Section 29 requires a guardian ap- pointed by the court to seek previous permission of the court for sale of any part of the immovable property of the ward. Section 31 of the Wards Act, empowers the court to grant the permission under Section 29 and lays down the procedure which may be followed inter alia sub section 3 (b) for sale of the immovable property of the minor. While granting permission sought by the appointed guardian to sell the mi- nor's property, necessity or an evident advantage to the minor, as an essential requirement under sub-section (1) of Section 31 has to be considered.

23. That said, the documents on record including the Aadhaar Cards of the subject wards, namely, Bharat Kumar state his year of birth as 2001 and that of Yashika is 20.01.2009. Bharat Kumar appeared be- fore the Court on 22.02.2020 recorded his statement that he was born on 28.08.2001. Bharat Kumar during the pendency of the present pro- ceedings attained the age of majority and accordingly on 22.02.2020 recorded his no objection statement in favour of the petitioners with regard to their appointment as guardians of his minor sister i.e. subject ward. It is held that the relief sought by the petitioners with regard to them being appointed as guardians of Bharat Kumar has become in- fructuous.

24. This Court observes and finds that there is no legal impediment to not allow the petition moved by the petitioners seeking their ap- pointment as lawful guardians of Yashika and her property, which has devolved upon her on account of the demise of her parents, particu- GP No. 14/2018 Page No. 10/14 larly, mother on 15.05.2018. It is also observed that no evidence has come on record and/or any objection from any quarter against the peti- tioners' appointment as guardians in person and property of subject ward. As a matter of fact, the close relatives from the paternal side and from the maternal side of the subject wards appeared before Court on 23.10.2018 and recorded their no objection statements in favour of the petitioners.

25. Further, the parents of the subject wards were of Hindu religion. As per Section 15 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, the property of a female Hindu dying intestate shall devolved upon her son and daughters (including the children of any predeceased son or daughter) and the husband. In the case at hand, the husband of Savita prede- ceased her on 12.12.2015 and as per Section 15 read with Section 16 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, the properties of Savita shall de- volve equally upon the subject wards. As it is observed earlier that one of the subject ward, namely, Bharat Kumar has attained majority, the petitioners can only be appointed guardians of subject ward - Yashika.

26. Accordingly, the petitioners are appointed as the guardians of the subject ward, namely, Yashika and also of her properties, particu- larly, bank accounts of Savita maintained with Punjab National Bank, B - 1, Community Centre, Janakpuri, New Delhi with regard to A/c No. 1503000109105139, and Bank of Baroda, Basant Gaon, New Delhi - 110057 A/c No. 2130100006931.

GP No. 14/2018 Page No. 11/14

27. Let a guardianship certificate be issued in favour of the petition- ers as the guardians in person and of the above mentioned bank ac- counts of the subject ward, namely, Yashika.

28. The petitioners are directed to deposit the one half of â¹14,63,689.35/- (Rupees Fourteen lakhs sixty three thousand six hundred eighty nine and thirty five paise) the balance in the account of Savita with Bank of Baroda, Basant Gaon, New Delhi in a fixed deposit receipt (FDR) with the State Bank of India, Sector 10, Dwarka Courts Complex, Delhi within 30 days from today in favour of the subject ward, Yashika. Let the fixed deposit receipt (FDR) remain deposited in the above manner with State Bank of India, Sector 10, Dwarka Courts Complex, Delhi until the subject ward attains the age of majority. The same shall be done under an intimation to this Court and the fixed deposit receipt shall be placed in court within 4(four) weeks from the date of deposit of the fixed deposit.

29. The petitioners are granted liberty to seek withdrawal of one half of the total balance in the account of Savita with Punjab National Bank, B-1, Community Centre, Janak Puri, New Delhi and deposit the same either in the bank account of Yashika, if any. This Court deems it necessary to direct the guardians, viz., petitioners that in case there is no bank account of the subject ward, namely, Yashika, to open a bank account with the nationalized bank closest to their place of residence or at State Bank of India, Dwarka Courts Complex, Sector-10, New Delhi in the name of the subject ward through the guardians for GP No. 14/2018 Page No. 12/14 current expenses of the ward's maintenance and also for investment of surplus money, if any. In order to enable a bank to open an account in the name of the subject ward through the guardians, let an attested copy of the guardianship certificate be supplied to the petitioners for compliance and necessary action.

30. This Court deems appropriate to observe that under no circumstance, this order shall be construed as an expression of opinion on the title of the subject ward over the subject properties.

31. The guardianship certificate shall be issued subject to filing of an indemnity bond in terms of Section 34(a) of the Act read with Rule 5 Part B Chapter 2 Volume II of the Delhi High Court Rules in the sum of one half of â¹14,63,689.35/- (Rupees Fourteen lakhs sixty three thousand six hundred eighty nine and thirty five paise). The bond shall be in Form 'D' annexed to the said Rules.

32. In view of Section 34(b) of the Act, petitioners are further di- rected to deliver to the Court, within 6(six) months from this date, a statement of the immovable property belonging to the ward, if any and also of the money received by them up to the date of delivering the statement. The bond shall, to the extent possible, be in Form 'E' an- nexed to the said Rules. The petitioners are directed to keep the bank passbooks, statements with them and produce them for inspection by the Court atleast once a year. The petitioners are also restricted to not remove the subject ward from the jurisdiction of the Union of India without having sought the leave of the Court in accordance with law.

33. The petition is disposed of in above terms. File be consigned to record room only after due compliance and necessary action, as per Rules. Digitally signed by HARGURVARINDER HARGURVARINDER SINGH JAGGI SINGH JAGGI Date: 2020.03.02 17:21:33 +0530 Pronounced in the open Court (Hargurvarinder Singh Jaggi) on March 02, 2020 Addl. District Judge-02 South West District Dwarka Courts Complex, Delhi GP No. 14/201",fm
"1. Late Sh.Harpal Singh Arora was the registered owner of property bearing municipal No.B-44, Vishal Enclave Rajouri Garden, New Delhi. He acquired ownership under a perpetual lease dated June 07, 1974 executed in his favour by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi. When he purchased the property on perpetual lease-hold basis, it consisted of only the ground floor. He constructed two floors above and sold them during his life time. He lived in the ground floor with his family comprising his wife Ms.Surinder Kaur and two sons named Raman Pal Singh and Gurpreet Singh and a daughter Sherry, who upon her marriage left the house.

2. Gurpreet Singh was married to Navneet Arora on May 15, 2001 and out of the wedlock a daughter was born to the couple on March 17, 2008. On a date not disclosed, Raman Pal Singh got married to Ms.Neetu. The family comprising Harpal Singh Arora, his wife Surinder Kaur, two sons Gurpreet Singh and Raman Pal Singh together with their wives resided together as one family, with one kitchen, on the ground floor of B-44, Vishal Enclave.

3. Harpal Singh died intestate on June 01, 2008 and was survived by his wife, two sons and daughter as the legal heirs. Each one inherited one forth share in the said property and other assets of the deceased Harpal Singh. On June 13, 2008 the three siblings executed a relinquishment deed in favour of their mother and thus in the official records Surinder Kaur became the owner of the property.

4. Tragedy struck the family when Gurpreet Singh died on May 20, 2012. Unfortunately, difference cropped between Surinder Kaur and her daughter-in-law Navneet Arora wife of Gurpreet Singh. Navneet Arora and her daughter were occupying one out of the three bed rooms on the ground floor. One room was occupied by Raman Pal Singh and Neetu Arora. The third by Surinder Kaur.

5. Surinder Kaur filed a suit for permanent and mandatory injunction against Navneet Arora, Raman Pal Singh and his wife Neetu Arora. It related to the ground floor.

6. As was to be expected, Raman Pal Singh and Neetu Arora, obviously collusively, informed the Court that they would move out of the room occupied by them, but we take on record the fact that the two continue to reside on the ground floor of the property.

7. Navneet Arora filed a written statement pointing out that she had filed a civil suit registered as number 203/2013 challenging the relinquishment deed executed by her husband in favour of Surinder Kaur which was pending before the Civil Judge, Tis Hazari Courts, Delhi. She pleaded that on the death of her husband his share would devolve upon her and her daughter and since the relinquishment deed was questioned by her, the suit filed by Surinder Kaur should await the decision in the suit filed by her. She claimed that she was living in her matrimonial house in her own right.

8. The learned Single Judge has held, vide impugned order dated March 21, 2014, that since Surinder Kaur was the owner of the property, it would not be a âshared householdâ of Navneet Arora in view of the law declared by the Supreme Court in the decision reported as (2007) 3 SCC 169 S.R.Batra & Anr. vs. Taruna Batra. The learned Single Judge has noted a few other decisions wherein it was held that an estranged daughter-in-law has no right to stay in the property owned by either her mother-in-law or her father-in-law. The learned Single Judge has held that at the old age of 60 Surinder Kaur would be entitled to a peaceful life.

9. The predecessor Division Bench before which the appeal came up for preliminary admission on April 30, 2014, having regard to the nature of the dispute, referred the parties to mediation. The mediation failed. The appeal was assigned to this Bench as per roster on August 14, 2014, and when it was brought to our notice that the parties are involved in multifarious litigation and two valuable assets being a shop at Jwala Heri market and a factory at Bahadurgarh, Haryana were lying locked, we had tried to effect a settlement between the parties and especially for the reason there is an outstanding loan in sum of approximately `2.36 crore for the house and `1.5 crore for the factory. The Bench had desired a solution where Navnit Arora could be provided a decent residential accommodation commensurate with her status in which she and her minor daughter could live and additionally some monthly made available to her for sustaining herself, and by way of reciprocity she could agree that the shop and the factory could be de-sealed, to be used by her brother-in-law Raman Pal Singh, but unfortunately so bitter are the relations between the parties that in spite of everybody realising that a status quo would damage each one of them, they refused to budge. Little realizing that if the Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company Limited enforces its right in the residential house for which as of August 26, 2014 the overdue amount was `2.36 crores, the house itself would be lost and if for the factory at Bahadurgarh the financial institution to which it was mortgaged also enforces the mortgaged, even the factory would be lost. We had expected Surinder Kaur and her son Raman Pal Singh, who had also been accompanying her to the Court, to take the lead because they were in a dominant position, but it did not happen because the two wanted reciprocity from Navneet as if she was in an equal position.

10. Thus, we are constrained to decide the appeal on merits.

11. Pithily stated, the question arising for the consideration of this Court revolves around the interpretation of the term âshared household' as envisaged under Section 2(s) of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 and if the present case stands squarely covered by the authoritative pronouncement of the Supreme Court of India reported as (2007) 3 SCC 169 S.R Batra & Anr. v. Taruna Batra (Smt.).

12. Section 2(s) of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 reads as under:-

""2 (s) ""shared household"" means a household where the person aggrieved lives or at any stage has lived in a domestic relationship either singly or along with the respondent and includes such a household whether owned or tenanted either jointly by the aggrieved person and the respondent, or owned or tenanted by either of them in respect of which either the aggrieved person or the respondent or both jointly or singly have any right, title, interest or equity and includes such a household which may belong to the joint family of which the respondent is a member, irrespective of whether the respondent or the aggrieved person has any right, title or interest in the shared household.""
13. Learned Counsel for Ms.Surinder Kaur had contended that in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in Taruna Batraâs case (Supra), a daughter-in-law, as the present appellant before us, is precluded under the scheme of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 to claim a âright of residence' in a premises exclusively owned by her mother-in-law even though she has admittedly resided therein with her husband and his family members in a domestic relationship. He would thus submit that the impugned order passed by the learned Single Judge suffers from no impropriety and is not liable to be interfered with in the present proceedings.

14. Since Ms.Surinder Kaur has planked her submissions on the decision of the Supreme Court in Taruna Batraâs case (Supra) and we find that the conclusion expressed by the learned Single Judge in the impugned order is also essentially premised on the said decision, it would therefore be incumbent upon us to carefully examine the dictum in Taruna Batraâs case (Supra) with a view to ascertain the factual conspectus and the issues which fell for consideration of the Supreme Court, in order to appreciate the observations contained in the said judgment.

15. A microscopic analysis of the said decision would reveal that Ms.Taruna Batra was married to the son of S.R.Batra and his wife on April 14, 2000. After the marriage the couple started residing together as husband and wife at second floor, B-135, Ashok Vihar, Phase-I, Delhi. It was not in dispute that the said property exclusively belonged to S.R.Batra's wife i.e. the mother-in-law of Taruna Batra. It would be pertinent to note that S.R.Batra and his wife resided separately on the ground floor of the said property. It was an admitted position that Ms.Taruna Batra had shifted to the residence of her parents owing to matrimonial acrimony with her husband. It was only much later that she sought to re-enter the suit property only to find a lock at the main entrance. In wake of such attending circumstances, she filed a suit seeking mandatory injunction to enable her to enter the house. It was the case of S.R.Batra and his wife before the Supreme Court and the Courts below that before any order came to be passed in the said suit, Ms.Taruna Batra along with her parents forcibly broke open the locks of the suit property. It was also contended by S.R.Batra and his wife that their son

- Amit Batra, the husband of Taruna Batra, had shifted to his own flat at Mohan Nagar, Ghaziabad before the litigation between the parties had ensued.

16. Perusal of the judgment further reveals that the learned Trial Judge vide order dated March 04, 2003, had held that Ms.Taruna Batra was in possession of the suit property and consequently granted temporary injunction in her favour. The said order of the learned Trial Judge was assailed in appeal before the learned Senior Civil Judge, Delhi, who vide order dated September 17, 2004 held that Ms.Taruna Batra was not residing in the second floor of the suit premises and also observed that her husband - Amit Batra was not living in the suit property, therefore, the matrimonial home could not be said to be a place where only the wife was residing. Laying a challenge to the order of the Appellate Court, Ms.Taurna Batra invoked the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court by filing a petition under Article 227 of Constitution of India. The learned Single Judge of this Court was pleased to hold that the second floor of the suit property was the matrimonial home of Ms.Taruna Batra and the fact that her husband shifted to Ghaziabad later would not make Ghaziabad the matrimonial home.

17. The Supreme Court after taking into consideration the factual matrix highlighted above, was pleased to observe in paragraph 21 of its judgment that this Court fell in error by interfering with the findings of the learned Senior Civil Judge who had categorically held that Ms.Taruna Batra was not residing in the suit premises. The Supreme Court was of the considered view that findings of fact rendered by Courts below could not be upset in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution.

18. We may notice that the provisions of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 were not pressed into service or taken into consideration by the Courts below, for the simple reason that the said Act was not enacted at the relevant point of time. However, at the stage of arguments before the Supreme Court the said Act was in force and consequently the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of Ms.Taruna Batra invited the attention of the Supreme Court to the provisions of the said Act, in order to contend that the definition of the âshared household' in terms of Section 2(s) of the said Act includes a household where the person aggrieved lives or at any stage had lived in a domestic relationship.

19. While repelling the said submission the Supreme Court observed in paragraph 26 of the judgment that if the aforesaid submission were to be accepted then it would mean that wherever the husband and wife lived together in the past that property would become a âshare household' for the purpose of the Act. It was quite possible that the husband and wife may have lived together at dozens of places such as the house of relatives of the husband and all such places would qualify as âshared household', thus entitling the wife to reside in all such places. The Court held that such an interpretation would lead to chaos and absurdity.

20. It was further observed in paragraph 30 of the judgment that the definition of âshared household' in Section 2(s) of the Act was not happily worded and appeared to be a result of clumsy drafting which necessitated the Court to provide a sensible interpretation to avoid chaos in the society.

21. The learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of Ms.Taruna Batra also relied upon Section 19(1)(f) of the Act in order to contend that she should be given an alternative accommodation.

22. The Supreme Court negatived the said contention and observed that the claim for alternative accommodation could only be made against the husband and not against the in-laws or other relatives of the husband.

23. In paragraph 29 of the judgment the Supreme Court adverted their consideration to Section 17(1) of the Act and opined that the wife would only be entitled to claim a right of residence in a shared household and a âshared household' would only mean the house belonging to or taken on rent by the husband, or the house which belongs to âthe joint familyâ of which the husband is a member. The Court proceeded to observe that the property in question neither belonged to the husband nor was it taken on rent by him and neither was the said property a joint family property of which the husband was a member. The said property was exclusively owned by the mother-in-law of Ms.Taruna Batra and thus could not be treated as a âshared household'.

24. Before we embark on the journey of culling-out the ratio of the above- noted decision, it would be instructive to take into consideration the luminous observations expressed by Earl of Halsbury L.C. in the celebrated pronouncement of the House of Lords in the decision reported as [1901] A.C. 495 Quinn v. Leathem -.

âNow, before discussing the case of Allen v. Flood - [1898] A.C. 1 and what decided therein, there are two observation of a general character which I wish to make, and one is to repeat what I have very often said before, that every judgment must be read as applicable to the particular facts proved, or assumed to be proved, since the generality of the expression which may be found there are not intended to be expositions of the whole law, but governed and qualified by the particular facts of the case in which such expressions are to be found. The other is that a case is only an authority for what it actually decides. I entirely deny that it can be quoted for a proposition that may seem to follow logically from it. Such a mode of reasoning assumes that the law is necessarily a logical code, whereas every lawyer must acknowledge that the law is not always logical at all.â

25. The said observations have been cited with approval since time immemorial by the Supreme Court. In the decision reported as (2007) 10 SCC 82 Sumtibai & Ors. v. Paras Finance Co. & Ors., the Supreme Court observed:

""10.As observed by this Court in State of Orissa v. Sudhansu Sekhar Misra - (1970) ILLJ 662 SC vide para 13:
A decision is only an authority for what it actually decides. What is of the essence in a decision is its ratio and not every observation found therein nor what logically follows from the various observations made in it. On this topic this is what Earl of Halsbury, LC said in Quinn v. Leathem, 1901 AC 495:
Now before discussing the case of Allen v. Flood (1898) AC 1 and what was decided therein, there are two observations of a general character which I wish to make, and one is to repeat what I have very often said before, that every judgment must be read as applicable to the particular facts proved, or assumed to be proved, since the generality of the expressions which may be found there are not intended to be expositions of the whole law, but governed and qualified by the particular facts of the case in which such expressions are to be found. The other is that a case is only an authority for what it actually decides. I entirely deny that it can be quoted for a proposition that may seem to follow logically from it. Such a mode of reasoning assumes that the law is necessarily a logical Code, whereas every lawyer must acknowledge that the law is not always logical at all.
11. In Ambica Quarry Works v. State of Gujarat and Ors.(1987) 1 SCC 213 (vide para 18) this Court observed: The ratio of any decision must be understood in the background of the facts of that case. It has been said long time ago that a case is only an authority for what it actually decides, and not what logically follows from it.
12. In Bhavnagar University v. Palitana Sugar Mills Pvt. Ltd - (2003) 2 SC 111 (vide para 59), this Court observed:
It is well settled that a little difference in facts or additional facts may make a lot of difference in the precedential value of a decision.
13. As held in Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. and Anr. v. N.R.Vairamani and Anr.- AIR 2004 SC 4778, a decision cannot be relied on without disclosing the factual situation. In the same Judgment this Court also observed:
Court should not place reliance on decisions without discussing as to how the factual situation fits in with the fact situation of the decision on which reliance is placed. Observations of Courts are neither to be read as Euclids theorems nor as provisions of the statute and that too taken out of the context. These observations must be read in the context in which they appear to have been stated. Judgments of Courts are not to be construed as statutes. To interpret words, phrases and provisions of a statute, it may become necessary for judges to embark into lengthy discussions but the discussion is meant to explain and not to define. Judges interpret statutes, they do not interpret judgments. They interpret words of statutes; their words are not to be interpreted as statutes.
In London Graving Dock Co. Ltd. v. Horton - 1951 AC 737 Lord Mac Dermot observed:
The matter cannot, of course, be settled merely by treating the ipsissima ventral of Willes, J. as though they were part of an Act of Parliament and applying the rules of interpretation appropriate thereto. This is not to detract from the great weight to be given to the language actually used by that most distinguished judge.
In Home Office v. Dorset Yacht Co. -1970 (2) AER 294 Lord Reid said, Lord Atkin`s speech...is not to be treated as if it was a statute definition it will require qualification in new circumstances. Megarry, J. in (1971) 1 WLR 1062 observed: One must not, of course, construe even a reserved judgment of Russell L. J. as if it were an Act of Parliament. And, in Herrington v. British Railways Board -1972 (2) WLR 537Lord Morris said:
There is always peril in treating the words of a speech or judgment as though they are words in a legislative enactment, and it is to be remembered that judicial utterances are made in the setting of the facts of a particular case.
Circumstantial flexibility, one additional or different fact may make a world of difference between conclusions in two cases. Disposal of cases by blindly placing reliance on a decision is not proper.
The following words of Lord Denning in the matter of applying precedents have become locus classicus:
Each case depends on its own facts and a close similarity between one case and another is not enough because even a single significant detail may alter the entire aspect, in deciding such cases, one should avoid the temptation to decide cases (as said by Cardozo, J. ) by matching the colour of one case against the colour of another. To decide therefore, on which side of the line a case falls, the broad resemblance to another case is not at all decisive.
*** Precedent should be followed only so far as it marks the path of justice, but you must cut the dead wood and trim off the side branches else you will find yourself lost in thickets and branches. My plea is to keep the path of justice clear of obstructions which could impede it.""
26. The said observations are indeed a lodestar and valuably guide us to appreciate the observations of the Supreme Court in Taruna Batraâs case (Supra) in the correct perspective.

27. As highlighted earlier, while deciding Taruna Batra's case (Supra) the Supreme Court took into consideration the fact that after the marriage Ms.Taruna Batra and her husband - Amit Batra started living at the second floor of the suit premises, whereas the in-laws resided separately on the ground floor of the suit property. In view of the said state of affairs, it is palpably evident that Ms.Taruna Batra and her husband were not living together with Ms.Taruna Batra's in-laws, as members of âjoint family' in the legal-sense and the second floor of the suit-property would not qualify as the âshared household' in terms of Section 2(s) of the Act. The fact that the husband and wife resided on a separate floor altogether is indicative of the fact that they were not living as a âjoint family' with the in-laws of Ms.Taruna Batra.

28. It is a settled proposition that to constitute a âjoint family' the members thereof must not only reside together but partake meals prepared from a common kitchen, whereas it appears from the perusal of the judgment rendered in Taruna Batra's case (Supra) that there was nothing to indicate that the kitchen was common.

29. The term âJoint Family' has not been defined under the Act. We find that the General Clauses Act, 1897 is also conspicuously silent in this regard. Therefore, this Court must traverse beyond to ascertain the true meaning and import of the term âJoint Family'.

30. It has been pertinently observed in the decision reported as (1914) 1KB 641 Camden (Marquis) v. IRC:-

âIt is for the court to interpret the statute as best it can. In so doing the court may no doubt assist itself in the discharge of its duty by any literary help which it can find, including of course the consultation of standard authors and references to well known and authoritative dictionaries.â
31. The Supreme Court has observed in the decision reported as 1985 Supp SCC 280 State of Orissa v. Titaghur Paper Mills Co. Ltd. that the court may take the aid of dictionaries to ascertain the meaning of a word in common parlance, where the word has not been statutorily defined or judicially interpreted.

32. The Supreme Court in its decision reported as (2004) 1 SCC 256 S. Samuel v. Union of India, held that when a word is not defined in the Act itself, it is permissible to refer to dictionaries to find out the general sense in which that word is understood in the common parlance. The Court sounded a note of caution that in selecting one out of the various meanings of a word, regard must always be had to the context, as it is a fundamental rule that the meaning as words and expressions used in an Act must take their colour from the context in which they appear.

33. Advanced Law Lexicon Dictionary, P. Ramanatha Aiyar, Third Edition, Wadhwa-Nagpur defines âJoint-Family' in the following terms:-

âJoint Family: ""Joint Family"" means a family of which the members live together, have a common mess and are descendants from a common ancestor and shall include wives or husbands, as the case may be, of its member, but shall exclude married daughters and their children. [Manipur Municipalities Act (43 of 1994), S. 2(27)]...â[Emphasis Supplied]
34. Iravati Karve opines that a âJoint Family' is a group of people who generally live under one roof, who eat food cooked at one hearth, who hold property in common, who participate in common worship and are related to each other as some particular type of kindred.

35. We may also note that the Act secures âright of residenceâ for an âaggrieved person' in a âshared householdâ which may belong to the âjoint familyâ of which ârespondentâ is a member, irrespective of whether the ârespondentâ or the âaggrieved personâ has any right, title or interest in the âshared householdâ.

36. The term âHousehold' is defined by Wharton's Law Lexicon, Fifteenth Edition, Universal Law Publishers in the following terms;-

â...Means the member of a family related to each other by blood, marriage or adoption and normally residing together and sharing meal or holding a common ration card. [National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005, S. 2(f)]â
37. This Court in its decision reported as 80 (1999) DLT 611 Hari Sharma v. Amarjit Singh Ramana whilst arriving at the conclusion that the husband and wife were living together as a family and the relations between them were cordial, ascribed importance to the fact that they were sharing a common kitchen.

38. It thus bears no reiteration that in Taruna Batra's case (Supra), Ms.Taruna Batra and her husband - Amit Batra were not residing with the Appellants as members of âjoint family' in a âshared household' as understood in the legalistic sense, the residence and kitchen being separate.

39. Thus,Ms.Taruna Batra could not derive any benefit from the provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 as she or her husband, either singly or jointly, had no right, title, interest or equity in the second floor of the suit property and neither was the couple residing as members of âJoint Family' with her in-laws and her mother-in- law was the exclusive owner of the suit property.

40. In paragraph 29 of the judgment the Court pertinently observed:-

â29. ...The property in question in the present case neither belongs to Amit Batra nor was it taken on rent by him nor is it a joint family property of which the husband Amit Batra is a member. It is the exclusive property of Appellant 2, mother of Amit Batra. Hence it cannot be called a ""shared household"". â [Emphasis Supplied]
41. The submission of the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Ms.Taruna Batra, as noted in paragraph 24 of the judgment, that merely because Ms.Taruna Batra had lived in the property in question in the past, it fell within the ambit of âshared household' was rejected by the Supreme Court, which was of the considered opinion that such a view would lead to chaos in the society since the wife may insist on claiming âright of residence' in virtually any property in which she may have resided together with her husband in the past.

42. Furthermore, the Supreme Court also observed that in view of the admitted fact that Ms.Taruna Batra had shifted to the residence of her parents owing to matrimonial disputes with her husband and was thus no longer in possession of the said portion of suit property, the question of protecting her possession could not arise. The very foundation of her claim for injunction restraining the in-laws from dispossessing her was thus wholly misconceived.

43. In light of the foregoing discussion, we are of the view that Taruna Batra's case (Supra) is only an authority for the proposition that a wife is precluded under the law from claiming âright of residence' in a premises, owned by the relatives of the husband, wherein she has lived with her husband separately, but not as a member of the âjoint family' along with the relatives of the husband who own the premises.

44. However, in the later eventuality, if a couple live as members of âjoint family' in a domestic relationship with the relatives of the husband in a premises owned by such relatives of the husband, statutory prescription would indeed enable the wife to claim âright of residence' since it would fall within the realm of âshared household' as contemplated under Section 2(s) of the Act irrespective of whether she or her husband has any right, title or interest in the âshared householdâ.

45. We may notice that Section 19(1)(a) of the Act clears the cloud, if any, as it mandates in unequivocal terms that a Magistrate disposing an application under sub-Section (1) of Section 12, may, on being satisfied that domestic violence has taken place, pass a residence order restraining the respondent from dispossessing or in any other manner disturbing the possession of the aggrieved person from the âshared household', whether or not the respondent has a legal or equitable interest in the âshared householdâ.

46. It is a settled tenet of construction of statutes that a statute must be read as a whole and not in a truncated manner.

47. It would be apposite to reproduce the observations comprised in 'Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes' by P. St. J. Langan, Twelfth Edition, 1976, N.M. Tripathi Private Ltd., at Pg. 47:-

""It was resolved in the case of Lincoln College- (1595) 3 Co. Rep. 58b that the good expositor of an Act of Parliament should ""make construction on all the parts together, and not of one part only of itself."" Lord Davey in Canada Sugar Refining Co. Ltd. v. R- [1898] A.C. 735 observed that ""every clause of a statute is to be construed with reference to the context and other clauses of the Act, so as, as far as possible, to make a consistent enactment of the whole statute.""...""
[Emphasis Supplied]
48. The Supreme Court in its decision reported as AIR 1963 SC 1241 State of W.B. v. Union of India, held that the Court must ascertain the intention of the legislature by directing its attention not merely to the clauses to be construed but to the entire statute; it must compare the clause with the other parts of the law, and the setting in which the clause to be interpreted occurs.
49. We are of the view that the plain language of the Act. viz. Section 2(s) read in conjunction with Section 19 (1)(a) is unambiguous and enables an aggrieved person to claim âright of residence' in a household even though the aggrieved person or the respondent may have no right, title or interest in the said household, if the aggrieved person and the respondent have lived therein by establishing a domestic relationship with the joint family of which the respondent is a member and to which such household belongs.

50. We may profitably refer to the authoritative treatise on statutory interpretation, 'Craies on Statute Law' by S.G.G. Edgar, Seventh Edition, First Indian Reprint, Universal Law Publishing Co., Pg. 65, wherein the author has taken note of a long line of English decisions on the subject commencing from (1832) 2 D. & Cl. (H.L.) 480 Warburton v. Loveland; (1864) 2 H. & C. 431 Att.- Gen. v. Sillem; (1881) 8 Q.B.D. 125 Att.- Gen. V. Noyes; (1889) 24 Q.B.D. 1 Hornsey L.B. v. Monarch Investment Building Society; [1891] A.C. 401 M'Cowan v. Baine; [1897] A.C. 22 Salomon v. Salomon; [1922] 1 A.C. 1 Sutters v. Briggs; [1959] 1 W.L.R. 995 I.R.C. v.

Collco Dealings, Same v. Lucbor Dealings; [1954] 1 Q.B. 439 (D.C.), Cf. Gluchowska v. Tottenham Borough Council wherein it has been held that where the language of an Act is clear and explicit, effect must be given to it, whatever may be the consequences, for in that case the words of the statute speak the intention of the legislature.

""On the facts and in the circumstances of the case the learned Commissioner of Wealth Tax (Appeals) has erred in holding the assessment made under section 16(3) as void by observing that the HUF consisted of two members and one of the members having died on 9-5-1991. As such the HUF had not existed when the assessment was made, ignoring the fact that for the Wealth Tax proceedings valuation date is relevant and on the relevant valuation date the HUF was very much existing and, therefore, assessment made subsequently was valid one"".

The learned Departmental Representative of revenue has contended that the death of one member of the family out of two members took place on 5-9-1991, whereas the valuation date for the last assessment year (assessment year 1990-91) involved in these appeals being 31-3-1990, none of these assessment years, gets affected by the said event of death on 5-9-1991. He has contended that the assessee-HUF has voluntarily filed Wealth Tax Return for all these years and this is mentioned in the assessment order also. He has contended that the learned Commissioner (Appeals)s basis for holding the reassessments for these assessment years to be invalid has been the death of one out of two remaining coparceners having already taken place by the time of making Wealth Tax Reassessments as the said reassessments for assessment years upto 1989-90 were made on 26-3-1992, and the reassessment for assessment year 1990-91 was made on 12-3-1993. He has contended that the learned Commissioner (Appeals) conclusion is not right inasmuch as it is only the valuation date of the respective assessment years which is relevant and not the date of assessment/reassessment. He has contended that on the respective valuation dates of the assessment years involved in these appeals, the HUF was very much existing. He has, in this regard, also drawn our attention to the provisions of section 3 of the Wealth Tax Act. He has contended that the HUF having once been in existence will come to an end only when complete partition of HUF is there. Citing N.V. Narendranath v. CWT (1969) 74 ITR 190 (SC) the learned Departmental Representative has contended that once property getting character of HUF the said character will not change till partition,. and that even on respective valuation dates in these cases there was no partition. He has contended that in the case of an HUF, property devolves by survivorship and not by inheritance to LRs. He has contended that the assessee voluntarily filed returns as HUF and so there is an admission on the part of the assessee regarding the existence of HUF. He also contended that in case the revenues plea is accepted then the matter should go back to the Commissioner (Appeals) for valuation to the properties as the valuation point has not been decided by the learned Commissioner (Appeals), but it was in issue before him. He has also contended that the Commissioner (Appeals) has relied on the Honble Karnataka High Court in CWT v. G.E. Narayana (1992) 60 Taxman 521 (Karn), but the same is distinguishable on facts.

6. As against this, the learned authorised representative of assessee has contended that the factual details are all available on record. He has contended that as regards the merits of the case, he relies on the orders of the learned Commissioner (Appeals) wherein the learned Commissioner (Appeals) has relied on the judgment of Honble Karnataka High Court (supra), and that the said judgment was followed in income-tax case also. He has referred to the order of Bangalore Tribunal in Asst. CIT v. Nanjappa (HUF) (2000) 74 ITD 407 (Bang-Trib). He has contended that the assessees HUF consisted of two members, that is, Karta Durlabhlal and his wife Shyama Devi. He has contended that they had one daughter who was married as long back as the year 1975. He has contended that for the purpose of making valid assessment/reassessment, the date of assessment/reassessment is material and on that date HUF of assessee was not existing. He has contended that Wealth Tax Act provides machinery for assessing LRS of individuals but not in the case of an HUF. He has also contended that in this case the issue regarding the character of property is not involved.

He has also contended that in this case the issue regarding the character of property is not involved.

7. In the rejoinder, the learned Departmental Representative of revenue has referred to section 19(2) of the Wealth Tax Act and contended that the said provision provides for the assessment of net wealth of a deceased-assessee, being an individual, to be made in the hands of the LRs of the deceased individual assessee. He has contended that so far as HUF and company are concerned, there are no provisions regarding assessments in respect of them in the hands of their LRs, and that it is presumed that an HUF never comes to an end. He has contended that HUF is governed by Hindu Law and a company is governed by Company Law and machinery is provided in those laws. He has contended that according to Hindu Law the assessees HUF was very much existing and the sole surviving member Durlabhlal continues to constitute HUF.

8. We have considered the rival contentions, the relevant material on record as also the cited decisions. In (1969) 74 ITR 190 (SC) (supra), the Honble Supreme Court has referred to their decision in the case of Gowli Buddanna v. CIT (1966) 60 ITR 293 (SC). In that case, one Buddappa, his wife, his two unmarried daughters and his unmarried son, Buddanna were members of an HUF. Buddappa died and after his death the question arose as to whether the income of the properties held by Buddanna as the sole surviving coparcener was assessable as the individual income of Buddanna or as the income of the HUF. It was held by the Honble Supreme Court that since the property which came, into the hands of Buddanna as the sole surviving coparcener was originally joint family property, it did not cease to belong to the joint family and income from it was assessable in the hands of Buddanna as income of the HUF.

9. In the cited facts of the case (1969) 74 ITR 190 (SC) (supra) the property sought to be taxed in the hands of the appellant originally belonged to the HUF consisting of the appellant, his father and his brothers. On partition of the said HUF, the appellant received his share of the properties originally belonging to the said HUF. Relying on the decision of Judicial Committee in Attorney General of Ceylon v. Arunachalam (1958) 34 ITD (ED) 42 (PC) it was held that ""it is only by analysing the nature of the rights of the members of the undivided family, both those in being and those yet to be born, that it can be determined whether the family property can properly be described as joint property of the undivided family"". The Honble Supreme Court held that when a coparcener having a wife and two minor daughters receives his share of the joint family properties on partition, such property in the hands of the coparcener belongs to the HUF of himself, wife and two minor daughters and cannot be assessed as individual property.""

10. For proper appreciation of the issue, it will be desirable to clarify some concepts of Hindu Law being relevant in the matter in hand. Here, we will discuss/elaborate the Hindu Law as per the Mitakshara School being the law prevalent in almost all the parts of India except West Bengal where Dayabhaga School of Hindu Law is followed which is also known as the Bengal School of Law. Under the Mitakshara School of Hindu Law there are two distinct concepts being of (i) ""A Joint Hindu family"" and (ii) ""A Hindu coparcenary"". So far as the concept of ""Joint Hindu family"" or an ""HUF"" under Hindu Law is concerned, it simply means a Hindu family consisting of all persons lineally descended from a common male ancestor together with their wives and unmarried daughters. Thus, the term ""Family"" signifies group of people or plurality of members mutually related by blood or by marriage or by adoption. Neither is it necessary that there must be two existing male members to constitute a Hindu joint family nor is it necessary that there must be at least one existing male member in the family to constitute a Hindu joint family. Under this system of Hindu law, even two females may constitute a joint Hindu family, no male member being there notwithstanding. As such, a ""Joint Hindu family"" or an ""HUF under Hindu Law, essentially denotes plurality of members and mutually so related as, mentioned above.

"The present criminal revision petition is against the order dated 10.06.2011 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Jalandhar whereby charges have been framed under Section 306 IPC against the petitioners.

Brief facts of the case are that the above said F.I.R was registered on the suicide note written by Rajinder Kumar @ Rajinder Kumar @ Raja alleging therein that Rajinder Kumar @ Raja was not having cordial relations with his wife Meenu, Hans Raj (father-in-law), Neelam Rani (sister-in-law) and Varinder Kumar @ Sonu (brother-in- law). It is alleged that Sonu was threatening Rajinder Kumar @ Raja and due to that he felt helpless. Before committing suicide, Rajinder Kumar @ Raja had applied to go to Saudi Arab but the passport authorities at Jalanhdar did not give him passport. He used to go to passport officer everyday as they used to call him but did not tell him anything. After being harassed by the persons of passport office, he committed suicide. He met the officer of passport officer but he too did not gave him any answer. The investigation was carried out by ASI Bikram Singh (P-2) and as per report under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short 'the Code'), it was submitted that ASI Bikram Singh reached the spot on receiving an information that Rajinder Kumar alias Rajinder Kumar @ Raja is hanging from the ceiling fan with the ""chunni"" in his room. Thereafter, ASI Bikram Singh along with Mulakh Raj 1951 HC Balbir Singh 1159 PHG Surinder Pal 2705 reached the spot and found a suicide note of Rajinder Kumar @ Raja near the bed. Thereafter, the suicide note of the deceased along with other papers of writings diary and signatures were taken in a sealed envelope and the same was submitted to FSL Chandigarh. Subsequently, Meenu (wife of the deceased) , Hans Raj (father-in-law), Neelam Rani (sister-in-law) and Sonu (brother-in-law) were arrested after making them join the investigation. A challan was presented on 14.02.2011. Statement of Jit Ram (father of deceased) was also recorded (P-3) who stated that Rajinder Kumar @ Raja was staying with his wife and children separately. He further stated that Meena Kumari alias Meenu (wife of Rajinder Kumar @ Raja) had gone to her parental house from quite some time. On 19.09.2010, Rajinder Kumar @ Raja was alone in the house and told his father that his in-laws family were harassing him lot in which his wife, brother-in-law and his wife, father- in-law were included. They were compelling him to die. Rajinder Kumar @ Raja had earlier quarreled with his wife and her in-laws used to call him with bad names threaten him to kill. Many times the compromise was effected, Meenu used to stay with her in-laws family and many a times used to stay in her parental house. On 20.09.2010, Rajinder Kumar @ Raja did not wake up and his Son Surinder Kumar told him that he called up many times on his phone but Rajinder Kumar @ Raja did not wake up. Thereafter, they opened the door from behind and found the dead body of Rajinder Kumar @ Raja was hanging with the fan besides his bed aside. Sarpanch of the village was then called who came to the spot and called the police. The police released the dead body of Rajinder Kumar @ Raja from the fan and recovered a notice hand written by Rajinder Kumar @ Raja. Rajinder Kumar @ Raja was not having cordial relations with his wife Meenu, Hans Raj (father-in-law), Neelam Rani (sister-in-law) and Sonu (brother-in-law) due to which he committed suicide.

Vide order dated 10.06.2011, the Additional Sessions Judge, Jalandhar has framed the charges under Section 306 IPC against wife Meenu, Hans Raj (father-in-law), Neelam Rani (sister-in-law) and Sonu (brother-in-law).

Learned counsel for the petitioners sought quashing of this order on the ground that as per the suicide note there are no direct allegations that the petitioners had instigated or abetted Rajinder Kumar @ Raja to commit suicide. The allegations against the in-laws family of Rajinder Kumar @ Raja are general in nature. It has further been argued by learned counsel that a specific role has been attributed to the Passport authority who had not issued him passport despite the fact that he had visited the passport authorities many times. Reference has been made to the harassment caused by the passport office. From the reading of the suicide note, one thing is clear that Rajinder Kumar @ Raja did not have cordial relations with his in-laws family but the contents of the suicide note did not make out a case of abetment as contemplated under Section 107 IPC to the extent that the in-laws had instigated Rajinder Kumar @ Raja to commit suicide. A close reading of the suicide note on the other hand makes reference to the fact that he had applied for the passport to go to Saudi Arab and the authority did not give him passport. He had visited the passport everyday and felt harassed by the officers of the passport office. The relationship between Rajinder Kumar @ Raja with his in-laws family was not cordial but it was not the immediate cause for Rajinder Kumar @ Raja to commit suicide. It is nowhere mentioned in the suicide note of Rajinder Kumar @ Raja that his in laws family had instigated him or threatened him before he committed suicide on 20.09.2010. As per the statement given by the father of Rajinder Kumar @ Raja Ram, it has been submitted that Meenu (wife of Rajinder Kumar @ Raja) had gone to her parental house for quite some time and on the date Rajinder Kumar @ Raja committed suicide, he was alone in the house since his wife along with children were not present. The allegation that her in-laws family had instigated Rajinder Kumar @ Raja before he committed suicide, so as to make out an offence under Section 306 IPC. As far as the Virender Kumar @ Sonu is concerned since he was not residing or he had not visited the deceased much before he committed suicide, the allegations that he had abetted him to commit suicide did not carry any weight.

Learned State counsel, on the other hand has argued that after framing of the charge , the petitioners are at liberty to take all the pleas before the trial Court. A suicide note clearly states that he was constantly harassed by her in-laws family . He had even applied for the passport to go to Saudi Arab. Due to his unhappy family life, he had committed suicide. Statement of father of the deceased as well as of Sarpanch of the village has also been recorded. Both in their statements have submitted that Rajinder Kumar @ Raja (deceased) has uncordial relations with his in-laws family. The compromise was also effected in the presence of Sarpanch but he was quite unhappy with his in-laws family as they used to harass him.

""Explanation 2 - Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitate the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.""
In the facts of the present case, as per the suicide note, the deceased was having uncordial relations with his in-laws family. He felt harassed and in that background, he had applied for the passport to go to Saudi Arab. As per explanation 2 of Section 107, the Court has to examine before he committed suicide nothing was done by the accused nor facilitate the commission of that act or said something to him. Since the relations were not cordial with his in-laws family as per the suicide note, it had to be a case of committing an act jointly by her wife and her in-laws family members. As per the statement given by Jit Ram, the wife of deceased Rajinder Kumar @ Raja was staying in her parental house for quite sometime. On the date of committing suicide on 20.09.2010, Rajinder Kumar @ Raja was alone at home. This fact has been stated by Sarpanch of the village in his statement.

In this respect the general rules of the acquiescence to the jurisdiction of the Court which may be valid in other matters and areas should be ignored and deemed inappropriate.

17. The second part of Clause (c) of Section 13 states that where the judgment is founded on a refusal to recognise the law of this country in cases in which such law is applicable, the judgment will not be recognised by the courts in this country. The marriages which take place in this country can only be under either the customary or the statutory law in force in this country. Hence, the only law that can be applicable to the matrimonial disputes is the one under which the parties are married, and no other law. When, therefore, a foreign judgment is founded on a jurisdiction or on a ground not recognised by such law, it is a judgment which is in defiance of the Law. Hence, it is not conclusive of the matters adjudicated therein and, therefore, unenforceable in this country. For the same reason, such a judgment will also be unenforceable under Clause (f) of Section 13, since such a judgment would obviously be in breach of the matrimonial law in force in this country.

18. Clause (d) of Section 13 which makes a foreign judgment unenforceable on the ground that the proceedings in which it is obtained are opposed to natural justice, states no more than an elementary principle on which any civilised system of justice rests. However, in matters concerning the family law such as the matrimonial disputes, this principle has to be extended to mean something more than mere compliance with the technical rules of procedure. If the rule of audi alteram partem has any meaning with reference to the proceedings in a foreign court, for the purposes of the rule it should not be deemed sufficient that the respondent has been duly served with the process of the court. It is necessary to ascertain whether the respondent was in a position to present or represent himself/herself and contest effectively the said proceedings. This requirement should apply equally to the appellate proceedings if and when they are filed by either party. If the foreign court has not ascertained and ensured such effective contest by requiring the petitioner to make all necessary provisions for the respondent to defend including the costs of travel, residence and litigation where necessary, it should be held that the proceedings are in breach of the principles of natural justice. It is for this reason that we find that the rules of Private International Law of some countries insist, even in commercial matters, that the action should be filed in the forum where the defendant is either domiciled or is habitually resident. It is only in special cases which is called special jurisdiction where the claim has some real link with other forum that a judgment of such forum is recognised. This jurisdictional principle is also recognised by the Judgments Convention of the European Community. If, therefore, the courts in this country also insist as a matter of rule that foreign matrimonial judgment will be recognised only if it is of the forum where the respondent is domiciled or habitually and permanently resides, the provisions of Clause (d) may be held to have been satisfied.

19. The provision of Clause (e) of Section 13 which requires that the courts in this country will not recognise a foreign judgment if it has been obtained by fraud, is self-evident. However, in view of the decision of this Court in Smt. Satya v. Teja Singh ... it must be understood that the fraud need not be only in relation to the merits of the matter but may also be in relation to jurisdictional facts.

20. From the aforesaid discussion the following rule can be deduced for recognising foreign matrimonial judgment in this country. The jurisdiction assumed by the foreign court as well as the ground on which the relief is granted must be in accordance with the matrimonial law under which the parties are married. The exceptions to this rule may be as follows: (i) where the matrimonial action is filed in the forum where the respondent is domiciled or habitually and permanently resides and the relief is granted on a ground available in the matrimonial law under which the parties are married; (ii) where the respondent voluntarily and effectively submits to the jurisdiction of the forum as discussed above and contests the claim which is based on a ground available under the matrimonial law under which the parties are married; (iii) where the respondent consents to the grant of the relief although the jurisdiction of the forum is not in accordance with the provisions of the matrimonial law of the parties.

21. The aforesaid rule with its stated exceptions has the merit of being just and equitable. It does no injustice to any of the parties. The parties do and ought to know their rights and obligations when they marry under a particular law. They cannot be heard to make a grievance about it later or allowed to bypass it by subterfuges as in the present case. The rule also has an advantage of rescuing the institution of marriage from the uncertain maze of the rules of the Private international Law of the different countries with regard to jurisdiction and merits based variously on domicile, nationality, residence - permanent or temporary or ad hoc, forum, proper law etc. and ensuring certainty in the most vital field of national life and conformity with pubic policy. The rule further takes account of the needs of modern life and makes due allowance to accommodate them. Above all, it gives protection to women, the most vulnerable section of our society, whatever the strata to which they may belong. In particular it frees them from the bondage of the tyrannical and servile rule that wife's domicile follows that of her husband and that it is the husband's domiciliary law which determines the jurisdiction and judges the merits of the case.

22. Since with regard to the jurisdiction of the forum as well as the ground on which it is passed the foreign decree in the present case is not in accordance with the Act under which the parties were married, and the respondent had not submitted to the jurisdiction of the court or consented to its passing, it cannot be recognised by the courts in this country and is, therefore, unenforceable.""

3.4 In the case of Smt. Neeraja Saraph vs. Shri Jayant V. Saraph3, the Supreme Court held that although it is a problem of Private International Law and is not easy to be resolved, but with change in social structure and rise of marriages with NRI the Union of India may consider enacting a law like the Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act, 1933 enacted by the British Parliament under Section 1 in pursuance of which the Government of United Kingdom issued Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments (India) Order, 1958. The Court recommended that feasibility of a legislation safeguarding interest of women may be examined by incorporating such provisions as-

JT 1994 (6) SC 488
(a) no marriage between a NRI and an Indian woman which has taken place in India may be annulled by a foreign court;
(b) provision may be made for adequate alimony to the wife in the property of the husband both in India and abroad;
(c) the decree granted by Indian courts may be made executable in foreign courts both on principle of comity and by entering into reciprocal agreements like Section 44A of the Civil Procedure Code which makes a foreign decree executable as it would have been a decree passed by that court.
3.5 The following Conventions4 need to be examined as to their relevancy and adaptability in the Indian context:

1. Convention of 24 October 1956 on the law applicable to maintenance obligations towards children
2. Convention of 15 April 1958 concerning the recognition and enforcement of decisions relating to maintenance obligations towards children
3. Convention of 5 October 1961 concerning the powers of authorities and the law applicable in respect of the protection of infants
4. Convention of 15 November 1965 on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Recognition of Decrees Relating to Adoptions
5. Convention of 1 June 1970 on the Recognition of Divorces and Legal Separations http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.listing, visited 23.03.2009
6. Convention of 2 October 1973 Concerning the International Administration of the Estates of Deceased Persons

9. Convention of 14 March 1978 on the Law Applicable to Matrimonial Property Regimes

10. Convention of 14 March 1978 on Celebration and Recognition of the Validity of Marriages

11. Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction

12. Convention of 1 August 1989 on the Law Applicable to Succession to the Estates of Deceased Persons

13. Convention of 19 October 1996 on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children

14. Convention of 23 November 2007 on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance

15. Protocol of 23 November 2007 on the Law Applicable to Maintenance Obligations IV INTER-PARENTAL CHILD REMOVAL - A PECULIAR PROBLEM 4 A very interesting, human and engrossing area of cross-border litigation arises in cases of inter-parental child abduction from foreign shores when a spouse removes the child to India in violation of a foreign court order. Unfortunately, India is not a party to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, 1980. Neither was Pakistan. But the UK-Pakistan Judicial Protocol was signed on January 17, 2003 by the President of the Family Division of the High Court of England and Wales and by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. It incorporated the effective provisions of the Hague Convention for the return of the abducted children to the country of the habitual residence. Perhaps, the crying need of the day exists for one in India also. Even though the British and Indian Governments have recently signed a treaty to extradite offenders of criminal law but in respect of matrimonial problems there is no such agreement, treaty or protocol. Even Legislative changes are still a far cry.

V SUGGESTED SOLUTIONS AND REMEDIES 5.1 What then is the remedy as a panacea for all such ills and legal problems?

5.2 A reading in totality of the matters in the overseas family law jurisdictions gives an indication that in such affairs, it is the judicial precedents which provide the much available guidance and judicial legislation on the subject. With the large number of non-resident Indians now permanently living in overseas jurisdictions, it has now become important that some composite legislation is enacted to deal with the problems of non-resident Indians to avoid them from importing judgments from foreign courts to India for implementation of their rights. The answer, therefore, lies in giving them law applicable to them as Indians rather than letting them invade the Indian system with judgments of foreign jurisdictions which do not find applicability in the Indian system. Hence, it is the Indian legislature which now seriously needs to review this issue and come out with a composite legislation for non-resident Indians in family law matters. Till this is done, foreign court judgments in domestic matters will keep cropping up and courts in India will continue with their salutary efforts in interpreting them in harmony with the Indian laws and doing substantial justice to parties in the most fair and equitable way. However, in this process, the Indian judiciary has made one thing very clear, i.e., the Indian Courts would not simply mechanically enforce judgments and decrees of foreign courts in family matters. The Indian courts have now started looking into the merits of the matters and deciding them on the considerations of Indian law in the best interest of the parties rather than simply implementing the orders without examining them. Fortunately, we can hail the Indian Judiciary for these laudable efforts and till such time when the Indian legislature comes to rescue with appropriate legislation, we seek solace with our unimpeachable and unstinted faith in the Indian Judiciary which is rendering a yeoman service.

5.3 In the context of the NRI, the following suggestions are mooted for improving the existing family law problems posed daily before NRIs and faced by affected people resident in India when they come in contact with NRIs. The solutions partly exist in proper implementation of existing laws, framing of proper regulations, creation of Family Courts and Fast-track Courts and amendment of existing legislation. The six point charter summary is set down as hereunder in the following sequence:

A. Registration of marriages must be made compulsory. This will in turn ensure compliance of conditions of a valid marriage, provide proof of marriage and act as a deterrent for bigamous practices. Section 8 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 makes it optional for State Governments to provide for rules for providing for registration of marriages. It is opined that States with significant NRI migration must make marriage registration compulsory particularly when one of the spouses is an NRI. Simultaneously, it should be made obligatory that the NRI spouse must give intimation of registration of his marriage to the concerned Embassy / High Commission in India, in which country he is presently resident. The States in India with high migration incidence should make and notify rules under Section 8 providing for compulsory registration of marriages and incidental matters related thereto. The Commission has already made similar recommendation as to registration of marriage and divorce in its 211th Report titled ""Laws on Registration of Marriage and Divorce - A Proposal for Consolidation and Reform"".
B. Dissolution of marriage on the ground of breakdown of marriage as an additional ground for divorce should be introduced when at least one of the spouses is an NRI subject to safeguards provided by legislation. This would require amendment of the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and the Special Marriage Act, 1954. Such a ground would provide NRI spouses a judicial forum in India to seek a remedy on Indian soil rather than importing foreign judgments of alien courts on breakdown grounds and give a chance to the Indian spouse to defend on convenient and equitable terms in Indian courts. The need for this amendment must be strongly mooted by the States with high NRI population to the Government of India to enact appropriate legislation by suitable amendments in the existing Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and Special Marriage Act, 1954 since inter-country migration from such States is significant and in large numbers. The Commission has recently recommended in its 217th Report as to incorporation of ""irretrievable breakdown of marriage"" as a ground for divorce in the said Acts. Further, the Law Commission in its 65th Report on ""Recognition of Foreign Divorces"" (1976) made a radical departure in suggesting that, in considering the questions about the recognition of foreign decrees of divorce, our courts should base their decisions not only on the question of domicile, but also on the basis of habitual residence and nationality. The said Report also considered the problem about the ancillary orders passed by the foreign courts in dealing with matrimonial proceedings and on this matter, the conclusion of the Commission was that these ancillary orders should not be treated as binding by our courts even though the foreign decrees of divorce are recognized. These ancillary orders concern the custody of children and other allied questions, and it was felt that it would be juristically imprudent to treat them as binding. The Commission had appended a Bill entitled ""The Recognition of Divorces and legal Separation Bill, 1976"" with the said Report to give shape to its recommendations.

C. Wherever one of the spouses is an NRI, parallel additions must be made in the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and the Special Marriage Act, 1954 to provide for provisions for maintenance and alimony of spouses, child custody and child support as also settlement of matrimonial property. This will ensure that the spouse / children on Indian soil are maintained and provided for in accordance with the income and standard of the NRI spouse in the foreign jurisdiction. It may also be worthwhile to suggest that under section 3 of The Family Courts Act, 1984, the respective State Governments where Family Courts have not been established should be directed to provide for Family Courts. The States with high NRI population which essentially needs Family Courts as a matter of dire urgency should immediately create such Courts to deal with family law problems and give priority to settlement of family law issues where parties are NRIs.

D. In the matters of succession, transfer of property, making / execution / implementation of wills, repatriation of NRI funds, the respective State Governments must simplify and streamline procedures. Ideally speaking, in matters having property problems, Fast-track Courts must be set up to deal with such cases expeditiously in accordance with a time bound schedule. The Punjab Government has made amendments in The East Punjab Rent Restrictions Act and the Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act for the summary trial of disputes regarding agricultural, commercial and residential property. However, no special Fast-track Courts exist in most States with high NRI population to settle these matters on priority. A fresh proposal should be mooted to set up such courts as soon as possible.

E. In the area of inter-parental child abduction or removal of children to India from foreign jurisdictions against court orders, India must become a signatory to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, 1980. As of now, there is no international convention or treaty applicable in India since India is not a signatory to the said Convention and other than conventional procedures, there are no remedies for enforcing such rights. Till such time there is no signing of such treaty, the State Governments with high NRI population should permit liaison with foreign missions in India through whom courts should be assisted to ensure return of children to the country of their foreign residence if they are removed in violation of foreign court orders. The administrative and police authorities in Indian States with high NRI population should give some uniform guidelines to observe to assist such parents in distress who often land in such States in India with no clue as to whom to approach for assistance. The Commission has already recommended in its 218th Report as to the need to accede to the said Convention of 1980.

F. Inter-country child adoption procedures must be simplified and a single uniform legislation must be provided for in matter of adoption of Indian children by NRIs. This should be hedged with ample checks and safeguards but at the same time should provide a unified, straightforward and single agency procedure. The present system is lengthy, complicated, involves multiple agencies, is very time consuming and thus needs to be suitably amended. Further, again the States in India with high NRI population should lay down some uniform policy guidelines to be observed by State agencies, adoption homes and administrative authorities so that proper help and guidance is available in adoption matters. The Law Commission in its 153rd Report on ""Inter-country Adoption"" prepared draft of a Bill on Inter-country Adoption. India has also ratified the Convention of 29 May 1993 on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter- country Adoption. Thus a simplified law should be enacted on the subject in the light of this Convention.

5.4 The above changes can be made either by providing a new composite legislation for NRIs or suitable changes can be made in existing legislations for streamlining the laws and procedures. It is suggested that a core committee of specialists in the field of Private International Law should be constituted at the earliest to prepare a comprehensive draft to suggest the said changes in legislation in the best possible way. It is the endeavour of the Law Commission to suggest to the Government of India to do whatever possible to improve the life of the NRIs in India. It is important to see what India can do for the NRI and not what the NRI can do for India.

We recommend accordingly.

"K.M. JOSEPH, J.

1. The appellant was accused No. 1 before the Trial Court and the appellant before the High Court, which, by the impugned judgement, confirmed the judgment of the Trial Court and convicted her under Section 18 of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS Act).

2. The prosecution case, briefly put, is as follows:

On 10.04.2004, ASI-PW7 and other police officials noticed the appellant and another Signature Not Verified accused approaching from 8, Marla Colony Digitally signed by ASHA SUNDRIYAL Date: 2020.03.02 16:21:38 IST Reason:

carrying a bag in their hands. On seeing the  police party, the accused allegedly turned back and started walking briskly. This aroused suspicion in the mind of the ASI. He intercepted them. The bag was suspected to contain narcotic items. The accused were informed that if they so desired, they could have search of the bag in the presence of a Gazetted Officer or Magistrate. The appellant desired search by a Gazetted Officer. The DSP came to the spot. On his directions, the search was carried out. The bag contained on weighment 6 kilograms 300 grams of opium. Samples were taken. Thereafter, the formal FIR was registered. On receipt of the FSL report and completing investigation, the charge- sheet was filed. Prosecution examined 8 witnesses. The appellant denied incriminating circumstances, in the questioning held under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. As noticed earlier, the High Court has affirmed the appellantâs conviction.

3. We have heard learned Counsel for the appellant. THE CONTENTIONS OF THE APPELLANT

4. It is firstly pointed out that Shri Om Parkash, DSP - Gazetted Officer, (in whose presence, the search was alleged by the prosecution was conducted) was present at the same time in respect of another case. In other words, he would submit that in connection with this case in his testimony, he has stated that he reached the spot at about 01:30 P.M. There is evidence that he remained there till about 03:00 P.M. However, this is refuted with reference to his testimony which has been produced in the Court, tending to show that he was present from 12:30 P.M. on the very same date in connection with another case and he remained there till 02:30 P.M. The question is, therefore, as to how the same person under whose gaze, the search was allegedly carried out, could be present at two different places at the same time. This brought under a cloud, the entire prosecution case runs the argument. Next, it is contended that the contraband, allegedly 6 kilograms 300 grams, was not produced before the Court. This vitiated the conviction. In this regard, reliance was placed on the following judgments of this Court:

(1) Jitendra and another v. State of M.P.1;
(2) Ashok alias Dangra Jaiswal v. State of Madhya Pradesh2; and (3) Gorakh Nath Prasad v. State of Bihar3.
5. No doubt, learned Counsel also draws our attention to the judgment of this Court in State of Rajasthan v. Sahi Ram4, where a contra view is essentially taken based on the fact that if a large quantity of contraband is involved, it may not be necessary to produce.

6. The next contention urged by learned Counsel for the appellant is that, though, it may be true that for searching the bag carried out by the accused, it may not be necessary to comply with the requirements of Section 50 of the Act but if there is also a personal search, Section 50 is attracted. In this context, he drew our attention to the judgment of 1 (2004) 10 SCC 562 2 (2011) 5 SCC 123 3 (2018) 2 SCC 305 4 (2019) 10 SCC 649 Bench of two learned Judges reported in Dilip and another v. State of M.P.5. Therein, it is, inter alia, stated as follows:

â16. In this case, the provisions of Section 50 might not have been required to be complied with so far as the search of scooter is concerned, but, keeping in view the fact that the person of the appellants was also searched, it was obligatory on the part of PW 10 to comply with the said provisions. It was not done.â
7. In fact, when it was pointed out by learned Counsel for the appellant that the aforesaid view has been disapproved by a Bench of three learned Judges in the decision in State of Punjab v. Baljinder Singh and another6, he pointed out that, in fact, a Bench of three learned Judges has come to rely on the decision by the Bench of two learned Judges in the judgment in SK. Raju alias Abdul Haque alias Jagga v. State of West Bengal7.

8. The last contention by the learned Counsel for the appellant is that the prosecution has not associated any independent witness in support of its 5 (2007) 1 SCC 450 6 (2019) 10 SCC 473 7 (2018) 9 SCC 708 case. He points out by referring to the judgment itself that there were witnesses available but still no witnesses other than the official witnesses have been enlisted in support of the prosecution case.

9. Per contra, learned Counsel for the State would submit that the time of arrival of Sh. Om Parkash, Gazetted Officer (DSP) has not been questioned. He further pointed out that the Court must bear in mind the lapse of time from the date of incident to the time of examination of the witness. Discrepancy in the timing should not be allowed to discredit the testimony of the witness. Still further, he submits that this is also a case where contraband articles were recovered from within the bag carried by the accused. For carrying out search of a bag as distinct from the person of the accused, there is no requirement to comply with Section 50. As regards, the contention that the contraband articles were not produced before the Court, it is submitted that it is not the law that the contraband articles must be produced. There is no provision in the Act which mandates its production. Still further, he would point out that the appellant has not raised this complaint before the Trial court or the High Court. There is no dispute raised by Counsel, in fact, that the contraband article, as such, is not produced. However, he pointed out that there is the FSL report. He supports the judgment of the High Court in regard to the non-production of any independent witness.

10. First question which falls for our consideration is whether there is merit in the contention of the appellant that no independent witness is produced. In this regard, the testimony of PW-6 is relied upon. In his cross-examination, he has, inter alia, stated as follows:

                   It   was    a   busy   place;    people      were
           passing      thereby.    Some    persons      from   the
public were called but they were reluctant but no action was taken. Resident of Kabri was asked to join the investigation. Sunil, Gulshan, were also do so. They were there at about 1:00 P.M. I did not know prem was Sarpanch or not of the village. They stopped for about 5 minutes at the spot. Some people were called from the  nearby shop but I do not know their names of the name of the shop.

11. It is, therefore, the case of the appellant, this is not a case where independent witnesses could not have been associated with the investigation and the prosecution.

12. We will deal with this after we also consider the other aspects. The next aspect which is highlighted, as already noticed, was the discrepancy brought out in the testimony of the Gazetted Officer, viz., the DSP who was allegedly called in by the ASI when upon being informed about the right under Section 50, the accused demanded compliance of Section 50 and on a telephone message, the DSP arrived at the spot. In his deposition, it is true that the Gazetted Officer (DSP) has deposed, inter alia, as follows:

He received a telephone call on his mobile phone from ASI. It was at about 01:10 P.M., he received the call. He reached the spot at about 01:30 P.M.
 The ASI examined as PW-7, has stated that the accused was apprehended at about 01:00 P.M. and they remained at the spot till 04:30 P.M. Notice under Section 50 of the Act, was given at about 01:05 P.M.. Message to the DSP was sent telephonically by about 01:05 P.M. He does not remember from the name of the shop from which the telephone call was made. The DSP/Gazetted Officer was present in the office at that time. The DSP came at about 01:20 P.M. He remained at the spot till 03.00 P.M.

13. The case of the appellant is based on the following testimony which was given by the very same, DSP in another case, which has been marked in the Trial Court. In the said case (viz., State v. Heera Lal), he states, inter alia, as follows:

On 10.04.2004, he was posted as DSP Head Quarters, Panipat. He was present in his office at about 12 Noon. He deposed to have received a telephone call from a  police officer that notice under Section 50 has been served and the person apprehended in the said case opted to have a search before a Gazetted Officer. He reached the spot at Jattal Road, near railway crossing at 8, Marla, Panipat. What is of relevance is that, he stated in his cross-examination that he remained at the spot upto 02:30 P.M. He reached the spot or place of occurrence at about 12:20 PM. The distance to the spot from his office was stated to be 2.5 km.
14. Thus, on the one hand, in this case, the very same officer has deposed that he reached the spot at about 01:30 P.M. and the ASI has deposed that he remained at the spot till 03:00 P.M. The DSP has deposed in connection with another case that he reached the spot of that investigation in connection with that case at about 12:20 P.M. and remained there till 02:30 P.M. The argument, therefore, is that from the evidence, the DSP must be present at the same time at two different places. This clearly rendered prosecution case suspect and benefit of doubt should at any rate must go to the accused.

15. As regards the contention of violation of Section 50 it is based on their being personal search of the accused. PW 6, the ASI has inter alia stated as follows:

Personal search of accused was taken by the lady constable under the shadow of the jeep. I do not rememberâ¦ I do not remember the direction of the jeep under which the personal search of the accused was taken. The lady constable has alone taken away the accused for personal searchâ¦. I do not remember whether at the time of personal search driver of the jeep was in the jeep or not.
16. Learned Counsel for the appellant drew our attention to the judgment of this Court in Dilip (supra). Therein, a Bench of two learned Judges held, inter alia, as follows:  ""16. In this case, the provisions of Section 50 might not have been required to be complied with so far as the search of scooter is concerned, but, keeping in view the fact that the person of the appellants was also searched, it was obligatory on the part of PW 10 to comply with the said provisions. It was not done.â

17. No doubt we notice the judgment of this Court rendered by a Bench of three learned Judges in SK. Raju (supra). Therein, the Court referred to the judgment in Dilip (supra), and thereafter, went on to, inter alia, hold as follows:

âAs soon as the search of the person take place the requirement of mandatory compliance with Section 50 is attracted irrespective of whether contraband is recovered from the person of the detainee or not.â

18. In the said case, the Court went on to hold that requirement of Section 50 was complied with. However, we notice a later development in the form of a judgment rendered by a Bench of three learned judges touching upon the correctness of the view expressed in Dilip (supra) as contained in paragraph 16 of the judgment.

19. In Baljinder Singh (supra), this Court elaborately considered the matter with reference to the applicability of Section 50 in a case where there is a personal search also.

20. This was the case where 7 bags of poppy husk each weighing 34 kg. were found from the vehicle. A personal search of the accused was undertaken after their arrest which did not lead to any recovery of contraband. The High Court found violation of Section 50 as the personal search of the accused was not conducted before the Magistrate/Gazetted Officer and set aside the conviction of the respondent. This Court, in Baljinder Singh (supra), went on to consider the law laid down by the Constitution Bench in Baldev Singh (supra) and, inter alia, held as follows:

â16. The conclusion (3) as recorded by the Constitution Bench in para 57 of its judgment in Baldev Singh [State of Punjab v. Baldev Singh, (1999) 6 SCC 172:
1999 SCC (Cri) 1080] clearly states that the conviction may not be based âonlyâ on the basis of possession of an illicit article recovered from personal search in violation of the requirements under Section 50 of the Act, but if there be other evidence on record, such material can certainly be looked into.

17. In the instant case, the personal search of the accused did not result in recovery of any contraband. Even if there was any such recovery, the same could not be relied upon for want of compliance of the requirements of Section 50 of the Act. But the search of the vehicle and recovery of contraband pursuant thereto having stood proved, merely because there was non-compliance of Section 50 of the Act as far as âpersonal searchâ was concerned, no benefit can be extended so as to invalidate the effect of recovery from the search of the vehicle. Any such idea would be directly in the teeth of conclusion (3) as aforesaid.

18. The decision of this Court in Dilip case [Dilip v. State of M.P., (2007) 1 SCC 450 : (2007) 1 SCC (Cri) 377] , however, has not adverted to the distinction as discussed hereinabove and proceeded to confer advantage upon the accused even in respect of recovery from the vehicle, on the ground that the requirements of Section 50 relating to personal search were not complied with. In our view, the decision of this Court in the said judgment in Dilip case [Dilip v. State of M.P., (2007) 1 SCC 450 : (2007) 1 SCC (Cri) 377] is not  correct and is opposed to the law laid down by this Court in Baldev Singh [State of Punjab v. Baldev Singh, (1999) 6 SCC 172 : 1999 SCC (Cri) 1080] and other judgments.â

21. Having regard to the judgment by the three-Judge Bench, which directly dealt with this issue, viz., the correctness of the view in Dilip (supra) reliance placed by the appellant on paragraph 16 may not be available. As already noticed, we are not oblivious of the observation which has been made in the other three Judge Bench judgment of this Court in SK. Raju (supra), which it appears, was not brought to the notice to the Bench which decided the case later in Baljinder Singh (supra). We notice however that the later decision draws inspiration from the Constitution Bench decision in Baldev Singh (supra). We also notice that this is not a case where anything was recovered on the alleged personal search. The recovery was effected from the bag for which it is settled law that compliance with Section 50 of the Act is not required.

22. The complaint, of non-production of the seized material, is based on case law of this Court originating with the judgment of this Court in Jitendra (supra). It is necessary to survey the case law beginning with Jitendra (supra). In the said case, it is necessary to notice certain facts. There were panch witnesses for the recovery examined by the prosecution. They turned hostile. Apart from the prosecution witnesses PW7, PW8 and PW6, there was found no independent witness regarding recovery. It is worthwhile to set out paragraph 6. It reads as under:

â6. In our view, the view taken by the High Court is unsustainable. In the trial it was necessary for the prosecution to establish by cogent evidence that the alleged quantities of charas and ganja were seized from the possession of the accused. The best evidence would have been the seized materials which ought to have been produced during the trial and marked as material objects. There is no explanation for this failure to produce them. Mere oral evidence as to their features and production of panchnama does not discharge the heavy burden which lies on the prosecution, particularly where the offence is punishable with a stringent sentence as under the NDPS Act. In this case, we notice that panchas have turned  hostile so the panchnama is nothing but a document written by the police officer concerned. The suggestion made by the defence in the cross-examination is worthy of notice. It was suggested to the prosecution witnesses that the landlady of the house in collusion with the police had lodged a false case only for evicting the accused from the house in which they were living. Finally, we notice that the investigating officer was also not examined. Against this background, to say that, despite the panch witnesses having turned hostile, the non-examination of the investigating officer and non-production of the seized drugs, the conviction under the NDPS Act can still be sustained, is far-fetched.â (Emphasis supplied)
23. We notice that this decision came to be followed in the judgment reported in Ashok alias Dangra Jaiswal (supra). Therein, the Court noted, apart from seizure witness turning hostile, which was found to be not an uncommon phenomenon, certain other features, as are narrated in paragraphs 10 and 11, which read as under:

â10. The seizure of the alleged narcotic substance is shown to have been made on 8-3-2005, at 11.45 in the evening. The samples taken from the seized substance were sent to the FSL on 10-3-
2005, along with the draft, Ext. P-31. The samples sent for forensic examination  were, however, not deposited at the FSL on that date but those came back to the police station on 12-3-2005 due to some mistake in the draft or with some query in respect of the draft. The samples were sent back to the FSL on 14-3-2005, after necessary corrections in the draft and/or giving reply to the query and on that date the samples were accepted at the FSL. From the time of the seizure in the late evening of 8-3-2005, till their deposit in the FSL on 14-3-2005, it is not clear where the samples were laid or were handled by how many people and in what ways.

11. The FSL report came on 21-3-2005, and on that basis the police submitted charge-sheet against the accused on 31-3- 2005, but the alleged narcotic substance that was seized from the accused, including the appellant was deposited in the malkhana about two months later on 28- 5-2005. There is no explanation where the seized substance was kept in the meanwhile.â

24. It is thereafter the Court noted that last but not the least the narcotic powder was never produced in the trial court as a material object and again there was no explanation for its non-production. It was found that there was no evidence to connect forensic report with the substance that was seized from the possession of the appellant or the other accused (see paragraph 12). It was in these circumstances the Court drew support from the judgment of this Court in Jitendra (supra). The appellant has not been able to demonstrate in the facts of this case any facts which could be likened to the facts stated in paragraphs 10 and 11. At least nothing was urged by the learned Counsel for the appellant on these lines.

25. Next judgment to be noticed is Vijay Jain v. State of Madhya Pradesh8. The first feature we notice is that the contention about the contraband not being produced was raised before the trial court (see paragraph 5). It was a case where a suitcase was produced as containing the alleged contraband. In regard to the suitcase, the evidence of PW11 was elaborately considered. It was found that the only evidence before the Court was that in the suitcase there was only a big pack wrapped in cloth and cloth was torn and there was blue colour polythene in which there were clothes. The evidence of PW11 did not 8 (2013) 14 SCC 527 reveal any brown sugar being found in the suitcase. No doubt, the Court referred to two samples being prepared. Then the Court noted that PW3 has stated before the court that those samples were not prepared in his presence. PW2 had stated that the witnesses were not taken to the site where the materials were seized. In Gorakh Nath Prasad (supra), the Court noted that neither the seized Ganja nor the sample drawn at the time of seizure was produced. The investigating officer-PW7 deposed there were no MR No. on the sealed material. He was also not sure whether the seized material had been kept at the Malkhana and also that it had not been produced in the Court. The independent witness with regard to the search and seizure, PW2 and PW3 turned hostile. In these circumstances, it appears the court went on to hold that non-production of the seized material was therefore fatal to the prosecution case. The Court thereafter referred to the judgment of Ashok (supra) following Jitendra (supra). Lastly, we notice the judgment of this Court in Mohinder Singh v. State of Punjab9. It was rendered by a Bench of three learned Judges. It was a case where the Trial Court had acquitted the appellant noticing, inter alia, that no order of the Magistrate was proved to show that the case property was produced before the Court. The High Court went on to reverse the acquittal and convicted the appellant. It is worthwhile to notice what this Court had said in the facts of this case:

â10. So far as the contention regarding production of the contraband seized from the accused, in his evidence, Harbhajan Singh (PW 3) stated that on 1-5-
1998, he produced the sample parcels and the case property parcels with the seal and the sample seals before the Judicial Magistrate, Ludhiana and the Magistrate has recorded the seals tallied with the specimen impression. Harbhajan Singh (PW

3) further stated that after return of the samples and the parcels from the court, the same were lodged by him to the Malkhana on 1-5-1998 itself. Baldev Singh (PW 5) the then Malkhana incharge though orally stated about the deposit of the contraband in the Malkhana, but Baldev Singh (PW 5) has not produced Register No. 19 maintained in the Malkhana to show the relevant entry in Register No. 19 as to 9 (2018) 18 SCC 540  deposit of the case property in the Malkhana. Oral evidence of Harbhajan Singh (PW 3) and Baldev Singh (PW 5) as to the deposit of the contraband seized from the accused with Malkhana is not corroborated by the documentary evidence, namely, the entry in Register No. 19.

11. After referring to the oral evidence of Joginder Singh (PW 2) and Harbhajan Singh (PW 3), the trial court in para 14 of its judgment has recorded the finding that no order of the Magistrate to prove the production of the contraband before the Magistrate was available on the file. After recording such observation, the trial court held that the oral evidence regarding production of the case property before the Magistrate was not trustworthy and not acceptable. In the absence of the order of the Magistrate showing that the contraband seized from the accused was produced before the Magistrate, the oral evidence adduced that the contraband was produced before the Magistrate cannot form the basis to record the conviction.â

26. Finally, it is necessary also to refer to paragraph 12 regarding the observation made therein. It would assume relevance, which reads as follows:

â12. For proving the offence under the NDPS Act, it is necessary for the prosecution to establish the quantity of  the contraband goods allegedly seized from the possession of the accused and the best evidence would be the court records as to the production of the contraband before the Magistrate and deposit of the same before the Malkhana or the document showing destruction of the contraband.â
27. For determining the exact provision applicable under the law, viz., whether the offence relates to commercial quantity or the other categories, it may be necessary.

28. In the facts of this case we, however, notice certain features. Before the Trial Court, the contention as such that not seen raised about the non-production of the contraband articles. We may also however refer to the judgment of this Court in Sahi Ram (supra). This was a case where the vehicle was searched, during which 7 bags of poppy straw, the gross weight being 233 kg., were found behind the driverâs seat. Samples were taken. The High court in appeal by the respondent found that only 2 sample packets and one bag of poppy straw weighing 2.5 kg. were produced and relying upon the case law which we have referred to, acquitted the respondent. The Court also noted paragraph 9 of the judgment in Jitendra (supra) where the court observed, taking the cumulative effect of all circumstances, it was not sufficient to bring home the charge. The Court also referred to the judgment of this Court in Mohinder Singh (supra).

29. The Court also went to hold in Sahi Ram (supra) that if seizure is otherwise proved on record and it is not even doubted or disputed, it need not be placed before the Court. The Court further held that if the seizure is otherwise proved what is required to be proved is the fact that samples taken out of a contraband are kept intact. This Court held as follows:

â15. It is true that in all the aforesaid cases submission was advanced on behalf of the accused that failure to produce contraband material before the Court ought to result in acquittal of the accused.
However, in none of the aforesaid cases the said submission singularly weighed with this Court to extend benefit of acquittal only on that ground. As is clear from the decision of this Court in Jitendra [Jitendra v. State of M.P., (2004) 10 SCC 562: 2004 SCC (Cri) 2028], apart from the aforesaid submission other facets of the matter also weighed with the Court which is evident from paras 7 to 9 of the decision.

Similarly in Ashok [Ashok v. State of M.P., (2011) 5 SCC 123 : (2011) 2 SCC (Cri) 547], the fact that there was no explanation where the seized substance was kept (para 11) and the further fact that there was no evidence to connect the forensic report with the substance that was seized, (para 12) were also relied upon while extending benefit of doubt in favour of the accused. Similarly, in Vijay Jain [Vijay Jain v. State of M.P., (2013) 14 SCC 527 : (2014) 4 SCC (Cri) 276] , the fact that the evidence on record did not establish that the material was seized from the appellants, was one of the relevant circumstances. In the latest decision of this Court in Vijay Pandey [Vijay Pandey v. State of U.P., (2019) 18 SCC 215 : 2019 SCC Online SC 942] , again the fact that there was no evidence to connect the forensic report with the substance that was seized was also relied upon to extend the benefit of acquittal.

16. It is thus clear that in none of the decisions of this Court, non- production of the contraband material before the court has singularly been found to be sufficient to grant the benefit of acquittal.

 xxx xxx xxx xxx

18. If the seizure of the material is otherwise proved on record and is not even doubted or disputed, the entire contraband material need not be placed before the court. If the seizure is otherwise not in doubt, there is no requirement that the entire material ought to be produced before the court. At times the material could be so bulky, for instance as in the present material when those 7 bags weighed 223 kg that it may not be possible and feasible to produce the entire bulk before the court. If the seizure is otherwise proved, what is required to be proved is the fact that the samples taken from and out of the contraband material were kept intact, that when the samples were submitted for forensic examination the seals were intact, that the report of the forensic experts shows the potency, nature and quality of the contraband material and that based on such material, the essential ingredients constituting an offence are made out.â

30. In the facts of this case, no doubt the contraband article weighed 6 kg 300 gms. A perusal of the judgment of the Trial Court does not appear to suggest the appellant had taken the contention regarding non-production of the contraband before the trial Court. This contention as such is not seen as taken before the High Court. This is a case where the sample was produced. There is no argument relating to the tampering with the seal. We further notice that in the deposition of the investigating officer (PW7), he has stated as follows:

âThe case property is Exhibit P1, sample is Exhibit P2, sample seal is Exhibit P3 and the bag in which the case property was recovered from the possession of the accused present in the Court is Exhibit P4.â
31. In the facts of this case, we have no hesitation to reject the contention of the appellant.

32. Next aspect, which we consider is, whether the conviction of the appellant made by two courts requires interference on the ground that independent witnesses were not associated with the investigation, seizure and recovery. We have noticed the evidence which is referred to by the appellant to criticize the impugned judgment on this score. Two courts have reposed confidence in the deposition of the prosecution witnesses. The Investigation Officer- PW7, when examined, has stated as follows:





                ââ¦At the time of apprehension of
         accused       none     from     the    public     was
         there.     There were shops but there was
         no     residential          house.     Residential
colony is at some distance. No woman from the locality was called. Some respectables were tried to be called. I do not remember the names of the said persons. Prem Singh son of Raja Ram resident of Kahri, Sunil son of Ram Mehar resident of Panipat, Gushan Kumar son of Gainda Ram resident of 8 Marla Colony, Panipat were asked to do so. It was about 2 P.M. DSP had also arrived. The aforesaid persons remained with us for 5/10 minutes. They had showed their inability to such a nature that I did not think it proper to take legal action against them. No shop keeper was calledâ¦â

33. In the light of this we do not think that a case has been made for overturning the verdict of guilt returned against the appellant.

34. In the circumstances, as noted above, though there appears to be doubt created about whether the DSP was present, upon being called by PW7 having regard to the testimony of the DSP in the other case, in view of the fact that the contraband articles were in fact recovered upon search of the bag, and bearing in mind the view taken by this Court in Baljinder Singh (supra), we do not find merit in the argument of the appellant.

35. Lastly, the learned Counsel for the appellant made a fervent plea in this case that should his contentions not be found acceptable, the Court may direct that appellant may not suffer further incarceration in the State of Haryana but may consider her being housed in a jail in the State of Madhya Pradesh where she would have access to her family members. This is a matter which we leave upon to the appellant to seek appropriate relief. Subject to the same, the appeal stands dismissed. Since the appellant is on bail, her bail bond shall stand cancelled.",fm
"The appellant contends that the law which enables the Expenditure-tax Officer to assess tax on the expenditure of all members of the Hindu undivided family governed by the Marumakkattayam law, discriminates, on the ground of religion, between the Hindu undivided family and a Mappilla undivided family governed by the Marumakkattayam law resident in North Malabar.

Section 3 of the Expenditure-tax Act 29 of 1957 is the charging section : insofar 'as it is relevant it reads ""(1) Subject to the other provisions contained in this Act, there shall be charged for every financial year, commencing on and from the first day of April, 1958, a tax (hereinafter referred to as expenditure tax) at the rate or rates specified in the Schedule in respect-of the expenditure incurred by any individual or Hindu undivided family in the previous year Provided that Under the charging section tax is imposed on individuals and Hindu undivided families. An undivided family which consists of Hindus alone may be treated as a unit of assessment: an undivided family whose members are not Hindus will be assessed to tax as an ""individual"". Counsel for the appellant contends' that whereas a Hindu family governed by the Marumakkattayam law is assessed to expenditure-tax on the total expenditure incurred by all the members of the undivided family, because the unit of taxation under s. 3 is the Hindu undivided family, a Mappilla undivided family governed by the Marumakkattayam law in North Malabar is liable to be assessed to tax as an ""individual"", and on that account at a lower rate.

The Mitakshara law of joint family is founded upon agnatic relationship : the undivided family is characterised by community of interest and unity of possession among persons descended from a common ancestor in the male line. The principal incident of Marumakkattayam law is that it is matriarchate : members of the family constituting a Marumakkattayam tarwad are descended through a common ancestress in the female line with equal rights in the property of the family. Under the customary Marumakkattayam law no partition of the family estate may be made, but items of the family property may by agreement be separately enjoyed by the members. On death of the interest of a member devolved by survivorship. Management of the family propeerty remained in the hands of the eldest male member, and in the absense of a male member a female member. A tarwad may consist of two or more branches known as thavazhies, each tavazhi or branch consisting of one of the female members of the tarwad and her children and all her descendants in the female line. Every tarwad consisted- of a mother 'and her children-male and female-living in commensality, with joint rights in property. The District of Malabar formed part of the State of Madras till October 31, 1956. The customary Marumakkattayam law applicable to Malabar was modified in certain- respects from time to time by the Madras Legislature e.g. the Malabar Marriage Act 4 of 1896, the Malabar Wills Act 5 of 1898. But the law relating to property relations between the members of the tarwad remained in its customary form till the fourth decade of this century. Under the customary law partition of the property of the family could not be claimed by an individual member or even by a thavazhi. It was so laid down by a course of judicial decisions' for over 75 years, and this rule was accepted as settled law till the Madras Legislature. enacted the Madras Marumakkattayam Act, 22 of 1933 and the Mappilla Marumakkattayam Act 17 of 1939, the former applying to Hindus and the latter to Mappillas who are Muslims. There were however significant difference between the two Acts. Under Act 22 of 1933 only a tarwad could claim partition (s. 38) (by the Madras Marumakkattayam (Amendment) Act 26 of 1958 enacted by the Kerala Legislature the right to claim partition was also granted to individual members); property obtained by partition was held with incidents of tarwad property [s. 38(2)]; and the Karnavan was not require& to maintain an inventory of the property, but had to maintain a true and correct account of the income and expenditure of the tarwad. By the Madras Act 17 of 1939 any member of a Mappilla tarwad could claim partition' (ss. 13 & 14); succession to property obtained by partition was governed by Istamic law (s. 18); the Karnavan was required to maintain an inventory of family property (s. 3); any member of the family could apply to the Court for an order directing the Karnavan to give inspection of accounts or inventory [s. 5(2)] surplus income had to be invested by the Karnavan (s. 7); and the Karnavan could be removed by a suit (s. 11) These and other statutory Modifications were applicable only to the Malabar area which was originally part of the State of Madras and not to the State of Travancore-Cochin as it existed before the States Reorganization Act, 1956. There were several legislative measures in the States of Travancore and Cochin before those States merged with the Indian Union, and in the State of Travancore-Cochin after merger and in the State of Kerala, making changes in the customary Marumakkattayam law: these were the Cochin Makkathayam Thiyya Act 17 of 1115 (M.E.); Cochin Marumakkattayam Act 13 of 1095 (M.E.). Cochin Nair Act 13 of 1095 (M.E.) and Act 29 of 1113 (M.E.); Cochin Paliam Tarwad Act 8 of 1097 (M.F); Cochin Thiyya Act 8 of 1107 (M.E.); Travancore Nanjinad Vellala Regulation 6 of 1101 (M.E.); Travancore Nayar Regulation 1 of 1088 (M.E.) and 11 of 1100 (M.E.) Travancore Wills Act 6 of 1074 (M.E.). It is sufficient to observe that by these statutes significant changes were made in the customary laws governing the family and property relations between the members governed by the Marumakkattayam law.

The Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act 78 of 1956 the Hindu Marriage Act 23 of 1955 also apply to Hindus governed by the Marumakkattayam law and modify the law relating to family relations.

Initially a common system of law relating to family property of the tarwad was applicable to Hindus and Mapillas governed by the Marumakkattayam law. Since the enactment of Madras Act 22 of 1933, and the other Acts governing the Hindus, and Act 17 of 1939 governing the Mappillas, points of similarity even in property relations in the tarwads have considerably narrowed. Application of the Islamic laws of marriage and inheritance to the Mappillas led to greater cleavage. If a member of a Mappilla Marumakkattayam family married a person not governed by the Marumakkattayam law, property of the person governed by Marumakkattayam law apparently devolved according to that system of law, whereas the property of the person governed by the Islamic law devolved according to Islamic rules of succession. The result was that whereas the interest of a, Mappilla governed by the Marumakkatayam law devolved by survivorship, his separate property descended by inheritance in accordance with the Islamic law. Hindus governed by the Marumakkattayam law, since the enactment of the Hindu Succession Act remained members of the undivided family, but on death the interest devolved by the rules prescribed by the Hindu Succession Act. In a Hindu tarwad governed by the Marumakkattayam law the descent is matriarch-ate and all members male and female have equal shares in the property of the tarwad. Though not a family governed by the Mitakshara law, it is still a Hindu undivided family within the meaning of the Expenditure-tax Act. The property relations between members of a Mappilla Marumakkattayam tarwad governed by the matriarchate with equal shares for males and females were in certain respects, already stated, different from the relations between members of a Hindu joint family governed by the Marumakkattayam law. The community of Mappillas governed by the Marumakkattayam law is, compared to the Hindus, a small community restricted only to the northern area of the Malabar District. it is again a dwindling community because of the impact of the law of inheritance applicable to share obtained on partition. it is in the light of these special characteristics that-the plea of discrimination must be considered. Equal protection clause of the Constitution does not enjoin equal protection of the laws as abstract propositions. Laws being the expression of legislative will intended to solve specific 8 33 problems or to achieve definite objectives by specific remedies, absolute, equality or uniformity of treatment is impossible of achievement. Again tax laws are aimed at dealing with complex problems of infinite variety necessitating adjustment of several disparate elements. The Courts accordingly admit, subject to adherence to the fundamental principles of the doctrine of equality, a larger play to legislative discretion in the matter of Clai- fication. The power to classify may be exercised so as to adjust the system of taxation in all proper and reasonable ways the Legislature may select persons, properties, transactions :and objects, and apply different methods and even rates of tax, if the ,Legislature does so reasonably. Protection of the equality clause does not predicate a mathematically precise or logically complete or symmetrical classification : it is not a condition of the guarantee of equal protection that all transactions, properties, objects or persons of the same genus must be affected by it or at all. If the classification is rational, the Legislature is free to choose objects of taxation, impose different rates, exempt classes of property from taxation, subject different classes of property to tax in different ways and adopt different modes of assessment. A taxing statute may contravene Art. 14 of the Constitution if it seeks to impose on the same class of property, persons, transactions or occupations similarly situate, incidence of taxation, which leads to obvious inequality. A taxing statute is not, therefore, exposed to attack on the ground of discrimination merely because different rates of taxation are prescribed for different categories of persons, transactions, occupations or objects.

It is unnecessary to multiply citations.

The Parliament has declared for the purpose of the Expendi- ture-tax Act an undivided family of Hindus as a unit of taxation and imposed tax at the rates prescribed. To fall within the description the unit must be an undivided family of Hindus. Within the expression ""Hindu undivided family"" will fall an undivided family of Hindus governed by the Marumakkattayam law. Even though the basic scheme of a Hindu undivided family governed by the Mitakshara law and the Marumakkattayam law is different in two important respects, viz. the descent is through females and children both males and females have equal rights to pro-perty-these families are still Hindu undivided families. The law applicable to Hindu undivided family governed by the Marumakkattayam law, and to the Mappilla. tarwad in North Malabar has the same characteristics in two principal respects(a) descent is traced through females; and , (b) there is community of interest and unity of possession in respect of the family property. But the laws applicable to those families in other respects widely differ. The Mappilla families governed by the Marumakkattayam law reside in a small part of the country and form numerically a small community. The Parliament has again been accustomed 8 35 in enacting tax laws to make a 'distinction between a Hindu Undivided Family consisting of Hindus and undivided families of Mappillas. By the taxing Acts the Parliament could have treated Mappilla tarwads as units of taxation. But the mere fact that the law could, have been extended to another class of persons who have certain characteristics similar to a section of the Hindus but have not been so included is not a ground for striking down the law. In treating a Hindu Undivided Family as a unit of taxation under the Expenditure-tax Act and not a Non-Hindu Undivided Family the Parliament has not attempted an ""obvious inequality"". Under the taxing Acts the scheme of treating a Hindu Un- divided Family has been adopted for a long time, e.g., the Indian income-tax Act IX of 1869, Indian Income-tax Act IX of 1870, Indian Income-tax Act XII of 1871, Act VIII of 1872, Act 11 of 1886, Act VII of 1918, Act XI of 1922, Act 43 of 1961 have treated a Hindu Undivided Family as a distinct taxable entity. Similarly under the Wealth-tax Act 27 of 1957 and the Gift-tax Act 18 of 1958, the Hindu Undivided Family is made a unit of taxation. Under the Business Profits Tax Act 21 of 1947 and the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940 also the Hindu Undivided Family was made a unit of taxation. For the purposes of these Acts Mappilla tarwads governed by the Marumakkattayam law have been regarded as individuals.",fm

1. The plaintiff is a senior citizen and aged about 70 years. The plaintiff is the owner of the built up property bearing Municipal No.B-29, Shanti Nagar, Shiv Vihar measuring 100 sq. yards approximately (herein after referred to as ""suit property"") by virtue of Agreement to Sale, Receipt, General Power of Attorney dated 28.02.1989. The plaintiff by virtue of two sale deeds dated 02.09.1996 sold 50 sq. yards each (total 100 sq. yards) to Bhagwati Devi and Prahlad Singh out of total property measuring 200 sq. yards. The defendants shifted in portion of built property of the plaintiff as a licensee comprising two shops and one room as shown in red color in the site plan (herein after referred to as ""suit premises"") and rest of the portion of the suit property is used as common area by the parties.

The defendant no.1 is the son of the plaintiff. The defendant no.2 is the wife of the defendant no.1.

ISSUE WISE FINDINGS ARE AS UNDER ISSUE NO 1 Whether the suit of the plaintiff has not been valued properly for the purposes of court fees? OPP

7. The plaintiff stated that the value of the suit for the purpose of recovery of possession is Rs.10,00,000/-as per the circle rate. The plaintiff has claimed damages for the use and occupation of the suit property @ 8,000/- for the period with effect from April, 2017 to CS 277/17 CHAHATI DEVI V RAM DAS GUPTA & ANOTHER 4/15 October, 2017, total amounting to Rs.56,000/-. The plaintiff also valued the suit for the purpose of court fee and jurisdiction at Rs.130/-. The plaintiff has paid court fee of Rs.12,670/- for the reliefs of possession, damages and permanent injunction. The defendant no.1 alleged that the suit is liable to be dismissed for want of payment of court fee on the suit. The defendant no.2 alleged that the suit is not maintainable for want of payment of proper court fee.

8. Section 7(v) of the Court-fees Act, 1870 provides for Court-fee in suits for the possession of land, houses and gardens and lays down that the value of such a suit would be according to value of the subject-matter. It proceeds further and provides for what should be deemed to be the value of the subject-matter. Clause (e) provides that the value of the subject-matter, when it is a house or garden, will be the market value of the house or garden. The Patna High Court in Jagdish Chandra Ghose & others V Basant Kumar Bose & another, AIR 1963 Pat 308 considered issue what would be the basis of valuation of a suit for ejectment of a licensee when he continues to live in the licensed premises in spite of termination of his license. It was observed that no provision has been made specifically with regard to recovery of property from a person whose license in respect of that property has ended. It was observed as under:-

The difference between a tenant and a licensee is substantial. 'Lease' has been defined in Section 105 or the Transfer of Property Act, and 'license' has been defined in Section 52 of the Indian Easements Act (V of 1882). Whereas a tenant or lessee has a definite interest in the property which is put in his possession, a licensee has no such interest. There must be consideration for creation of a lease; but there may or may not be any consideration for grant of a license. While a tenant may hold over, in certain circumstances, after determination of his tenancy, a licensee cannot continue to be in possession or any property for more than a reasonable time after his license is terminated. There is, therefore, no escape from the conclusion that, if a licensee continues to be in possession of certain premises after ""expiry of a reasonable time from the date"" his license is revoked, he does so only as a trespasser. If, therefore, a suit is instituted for his eviction, it is clearly a suit for recovery of possession from a trespasser. The entire value of the property in question must be held to be the value of the subject-matter of the suit.
9. The plaintiff has purchased the suit property for a sale consideration of Rs.52,000/- in the year 1989. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants were in permissive possession of CS 277/17 CHAHATI DEVI V RAM DAS GUPTA & ANOTHER 5/15 the suit premises as licensee and license of the defendants have already been terminated. The defendants have not led any evidence to prove that the suit is not properly valued for the purpose of court fee and jurisdiction. The defendants did not mention current market value of the suit premises. In the absence of contrary evidence, it is proved that the suit is properly valued for the purpose of court fee and jurisdiction for the relief, as prayed for in the present suit. Issue no.1 is decided in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants.

ISSUE NO 2 Whether the suit of the plaintiff is liable to be dismissed under Section 41 of the Specific Relief Act? OPD

10. The defendant no2 in preliminary objections alleged that the suit is liable to be dis- missed under section 41 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 as the plaintiff has not appeared with clean hands and concealed material facts. Section 41 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 deals with conditions when injunction can be refused. The Supreme Court of India in Arunima Baruah V Union of India & others, Appeal (civil) 2205 of 2007 decided on 27th April, 2007 considered how far and to what extent suppression of fact by way of non- disclosure would affect a person's right of access to justice. The appellant filed a suit in the District Court but no order of ad-interim injunction was passed. The appellant filed a writ petition before the High Court without disclosing pendency of the said suit. The appellant before hearing of writ petition filed an application for withdrawal of the suit. The suit was allowed to be withdrawn after hearing of writ petition. The writ petition was dismissed by High Court due to concealment of fact by the petitioner and forum hunting. The appeal was also dismissed. It was observed as under:-

(t)o enable the court to refuse to exercise its discretionary jurisdic- tion suppression must be of material fact. What would be a material fact, suppression whereof would disentitle the appellant to obtain a discretionary relief, would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Material fact would mean material for the purpose of determination of the lis, the logical corollary whereof would be that whether the same was material for grant or denial of the relief. If the fact suppressed is not material for determination of the lis between the parties, the court may not refuse to exercise its discretionary ju- risdiction. It is also trite that a person invoking the discretionary ju-
risdiction of the court cannot be allowed to approach it with a pair of CS 277/17 CHAHATI DEVI V RAM DAS GUPTA & ANOTHER 6/15 dirty hands. But even if the said dirt is removed and the hands be- come clean, whether the relief would still be denied is the question.

11. In present suit the plaintiff pleaded that the plaintiff is the owner of the suit property by virtue of Agreement to Sale, Receipt, General Power of Attorney dated 28.02.1989 and allowed the defendants to shift in suit premise as licensee. The plaintiff got issued a legal notice dated 27.03.2017 whereby terminated the license of the defendants. The plaintiff as such disclosed all relevant material facts necessary for proper adjudication of the present suit. The defendant no.2 did not disclose material facts which are concealed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff did not conceal material facts in present suit. The issue no.2 is decided in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant no.2.

ISSUE NO 3 Whether the plaintiff is entitled for a decree of possession in respect of property bearing no.B-29, Shanti Nagar, Shiv Vihar, Delhi, as prayed in the plaint? OPP

12. The plaintiff pleaded that she was the owner of the suit property having purchased from Siri Ram Garg vide Agreement to Sell, General Power of Attorney and Receipt dated 28.02.1989 Ex.PW1/2 to Ex.PW1/4. The plaintiff has sold 50 sq. yards each to Bhagwati Devi and Prahlad Singh vide two Sale Deeds dated 02.09.1996. The plaintiff raised the construction in the remaining 100 sq. yards and after construction the defendants have shifted in suit premises comprising two shops and one room as shown in red color in the site plan Ex.PW1/1. The plaintiff has terminated the license of the defendants vide notice dated 27.03.2013 Ex.PW1/7 sent by post through postal receipts Ex.PW1/8. The plaintiff also disowned the defendants vide notice Ex.PW1/9 published in daily newspaper 'Amar Ujala'. The plaintiff in affidavit Ex.PW1/A also deposed above mentioned facts. The plaintiff in cross-examination conducted on behalf of the defendant no.1 denied the suggestions that she is not the owner of the suit property or that the defendants are owner of the suit property. The plaintiff was not cross-examined on behalf of the defendant no.2.

13. The contesting the defendant no.2 alleged that she along with her children is in the possession of the suit property which was handed over to the defendant as per family settlement. The defendant no.2 was never inducted as a licensee in the suit property. The defendant no.2 in affidavit Ex.DW1/A deposed that the suit property was purchased by defendant no.1 in the name of the plaintiff after disposing of the ancestral properties CS 277/17 CHAHATI DEVI V RAM DAS GUPTA & ANOTHER 7/15 situated in U.P. The defendant no.1 has constructed the ground floor of the suit property comprising of three shops, two rooms, one kitchen cum room, one toilet and varanda (courtyard). The defendant no.1 is running a confectionery shop in one shop and the defendant no.2 is running a cosmetics business in another shop. The plaintiff has given the suit property to the defendants out of the family settlement and also given other properties to remaining two sons namely, Pawan Kumar Gupta and Praveen Kumar Gupta. The defendant no.2 in cross-examination deposed that she has filed a complaint u/s.12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 against the plaintiff and other family members. The family settlement took place on 24.03.2015 but further said that the said family settlement was effected about 20-22 years ago. The defendant no.2 could not tell the exact date of the family settlement but admitted that no document was executed regarding the family settlement. The defendant no.2 as DW1 denied the suggestions that the defendants are not the owner of the suit property or that the defendant no.2 is residing in the suit property as a licensee or that she does not have any right in the suit property or that no family settlement was ever arrived at between the parties or that the suit property was not given to the defendant no.1 as family settlement or that the defendant no.2 is residing in the suit property illegally. The defendant no.2 admitted the service of the legal notice dated 27.03.2017.

14. The counsel for the plaintiff argued that the defendants have not challenged documents Ex.PW1/2 to Ex.PW1/4 regarding the ownership of the plaintiff in respect of the suit property. The defendant no.2 has not led any evidence regarding the family settlement as alleged in the written statement and affidavit Ex.DW1/A. The counsel for the plaintiff relied on Santosh Kumari v Mahendri & Others, 2018(4) CLJ 569 Del & Sachin & Another v Jhabbu Lal & Another, 2016(2) RCR 536. The counsel for the defendant no.1 argued that General Power of Attorney does not confer any right of ownership. The plaintiff has not led any evidence regarding the damages. The counsel for the defendant no.2 argued that the plaintiff has filed the present suit with a malafide intention as the defendant no.2 filed petition under Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 against the plaintiff and other family members including the defendant no.1 prior to the filing of the present suit. The counsel for the defendant no.2 relied on Vinay Varma v Kanika Pasricha & Another, 2020(1) Civil Court Cases 035(Delhi).

15. A license is a personal right granted to a person to do something upon immovable CS 277/17 CHAHATI DEVI V RAM DAS GUPTA & ANOTHER 8/15 property of the grantor and does not amount to the creation of interest in the property itself. It is purely a permissive right and is personal to the grantee. It creates no duties and obligations upon the persons making the grant and is, therefore, revocable except in certain circumstances expressly provided for in the Indian Easements act, 1882 itself. A license may be oral in which case, terms, conditions and the nature of the license, can be gathered from the purpose for which the license is granted coupled with the conduct of the parties and the circumstances which may have led to the grant of the license. Every license is governed by the provisions under the Indian Easements Act, 1882. A license does not confer an interest. According to English Law, a license is purely a personal privilege or right enabling the licensee to do something on the land of the licensor which would otherwise be unlawful. Section 52 of Indian Easements Act, 1882 defines license as under:-

Where one person grants to another, or to a definite number of other persons, a right to do or continue to do, in or upon immovable property of the grantor, something which would, in the absence of such rights, be unlawful, and such right does not amount to an easement or an interest in the property, the right is called a license.
Under Section 52 if a person is given the right to use the immovable property in a particular way under certain terms while retaining control and possession of the same, the person so permitted is only a licensee. The Supreme Court in Associated Hotels of India Ltd. v. R.N. Kapoor, AIR 1959 SC 1262 summed the concept of license as under:-

Under the aforesaid section, if a document gives only a right to use the property in particular way or under certain terms while it remains in the possession and control of the owner thereof, it will be a license. The legal possession, thereof, continues to be with the owner of the property, but the licensee is permitted to make use of the premises for a particular purpose. But for the permission, his occupation would be unlawful. It does not create in his favour any estate or interest in the property.
In M.N. Clubwala V Fida Hussain Saheb, [1964] 6 SCR 642 it was observed that whether an agreement creates between the parties the relationship of landlord and tenant or merely that of licensor and licensee the decisive consideration is the intention of the parties. This intention has to be ascertained on a consideration of all the relevant provisions in the agreement. In Rajbir Kaur and another V S. Chokesiri and Co., AIR 1988 SC 1845 it was CS 277/17 CHAHATI DEVI V RAM DAS GUPTA & ANOTHER 9/15 observed that the question whether a transaction is a lease or license turns on the operative intention of the parties and there is no single, simple litmus test to distinguish one from the other. In Delta International Limited V Shyam Sundar Ganeriwalla & another, AIR 1999 SC 2607 it was observed that to find out whether the document creates lease or license real test is to find out 'the intention of the parties' keeping in mind that in cases where exclusive possession is given, the line between lease and license is very thin.

16. It is reflecting from the combined reading and analysis of the respective pleadings and evidence of the plaintiff and the defendants is that the plaintiff was the owner of the suit property by virtue of Agreement to Sale Ex.PW1/2, General Power of Attorney Ex.PW1/3 and Receipt Ex.PW1/4 having purchased from Siri Ram Garg, S/o. Gauri Mal Garg, R/O.BÂ­123, Jyoti Colony, Shahdara, DelhiÂ­110032. The plaintiff sold 50 sq. yards each(total 100 sq. yards) to Bhagwati Devi and Prahlad Singh vide two Sale Deeds dated 02.09.1996. The defendants have not disputed specifically ownership of the plaintiff in respect of the suit property constructed on remaining 100 sq. yards and now bearing Municipal no.BÂ­29, Shanti Nagar, Shiv Vihar, Delhi. The defendants did not disclose or mention who else is the owner of the suit property. The counsel for the defendant no.1 argued that General Power of Attorney does not confer any right of ownership as title documents relied upon by the plaintiff are unregistered documents. The ownership document Ex.PW1/2 to Ex.PW1/4 relied on by the plaintiff were executed on 28.02.1989 i.e. prior to 24.09.2001 when by Act 48 of 2001, the provisions of section 53Â­A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 was amended along with related provisions of the Stamp Act, 1899 and Registration Act, 1908 and only as per these provisions after 24.09.2001 there was a requirement for stamping and registration of the documents. It is only an agreement to sell and related documents which are executed after 24.09.2001 require stamping and registration. (Reliance placed on Santosh Kumari V Mahendri & others, 2018(4)CLJ569Del.). There is no force in arguments advanced by counsel for the defendant no.1 that title documents Ex.PW1/2 to Ex.PW1/4 do not confer any ownership right in respect of suit property being unregistered and unstamped.

17. The plaintiff was having three sons namely, Ram Das Gupta i.e defendant no.1, Pawan Kumar Gupta and Praveen Kumar Gupta. The defendant no.1 got married with the defendant no.2 in the year 1994. The defendant no.1 and the defendant no.2 are not CS 277/17 CHAHATI DEVI V RAM DAS GUPTA & ANOTHER 10/15 enjoying healthy marital relationship and are under matrimonial litigation. The defendant no.2 has already filed a petition u/s.12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 against the plaintiff and other family members including the defendant no.1 which is still pending. The main plea which is taken by the contesting defendant no.2 is that the suit property was purchased by the defendant no.1 in the name of the plaintiff after disposing of the ancestral properties situated in Uttar Pradesh (U.P). However, the defendant no.2 has not taken said plea in the written statement. It was a material fact which was required to be mentioned in the written statement. In Maria Margarida Sequeria Fernandes V Erasmo Jack de Sequeria, (2012)5SCC370, the Supreme Court laid stress on purity of pleadings in civil cases. It was observed that pleadings are extremely important in civil cases and in order to do justice, it is necessary to give all details in the pleadings. This view was again reaffirmed in A. Shanmugam V Ariya Kshatriya Rajakula Vamsathu Madalaya Nandhavana Paripalanai Sangam, (2012)6SCC430. Even otherwise also the defendant no.2 has not led any evidence to prove that the suit property was purchased by the defendant no.1 in the name of the plaintiff after disposing of the ancestral properties situated in Uttar Pradesh(U.P). The documents Ex.PW1/2 to Ex.PW1/4 reflect that the plaintiff is the owner of the suit property.

18. The contesting defendant no.2 alleged that that the suit property was given to the defendant no.1 out of the family settlement by the plaintiff. The defendant no.1 did not mention that the suit property came into his share by virtue of family settlement. The defendant no.2 also did not disclose the details of the properties stated to be given to the other sons namely, Pawan Kumar Gupta and Praveen Kumar Gupta of the plaintiff out of the family settlement. The defendant no.2 in cross-examination admitted that she did not remember the exact date of the family settlement and no written document was executed at the time of family settlement. Initially the burden to prove was on the plaintiff that she is the owner of the suit property which the plaintiff has discharged by leading appropriate evidence. The onus to prove was on the defendant no.2 that the suit property came into the share of the defendant no.1 as per family settlement. It was observed in Rangammal V Kuppuswami and others, Civil Appeal No 562 of 2003 observed that burden of proof lies on the person who first asserts the fact and not on the one who denies that fact to be true. The responsibility of the defendant to prove a fact to be true would start only when the authenticity of the fact is proved by the plaintiff. In Anil Rishi V Gurbaksh Singh, (2006) CS 277/17 CHAHATI DEVI V RAM DAS GUPTA & ANOTHER 11/15 5 SCC 558 it has been held that the burden of proving the facts rests on the party who substantially asserts the affirmative issues. This view was also accepted in M/S. Gian Chand & Brothers and Another V Rattan Lal @ Rattan Singh, (2013) SCR 601. The defendant no.2 could not discharge the said onus by leading appropriate evidence. There is no evidence which can reflect that the plaintiff was the owner of the several properties and the suit property came into the share of the defendant no.1 as per family settlement. The plaintiff has already terminated the license of the defendants in respect of the premises under their possession vide legal notice dated 27.03.2017 Ex.PW1/7 which was sent through postal receipt Ex.PW1/8. The defendant no.1 in written statement and the defendant no.2 in cross-examination admitted the service of notice Ex.PW1/7. The plaintiff as such terminated the license of the defendants. It was observed by Delhi High Court in Sachin & another V Jhabbu Lal & another, 2016(2)RCR(Rent)536 that where the house is self-acquired house of the parents, son whether married or unmarried, has no legal right to live in that house and he can live in that house only at the mercy of his parents up to the time the parents allow and merely because the parents have allowed him to live in the house so long as his relations with the parents were cordial, does not mean that the parents have to bear his burden throughout his life. The plaintiff is as such entitled for the recovery of possession of the suit premises as shown in red color in the site plan Ex.PW1/1. Issue no 3 is decided in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants.",fm
"1. The question referred to this larger Bench is one of great importance in respect of the rights of inheritance to females governed by the Marumakkathayam law in Kerala. The question is whether Section 17 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 which deals with succession to females continues to be in force and operative notwithstanding the commencement of the Kerala Joint Hindu Family System (Abolition) Act, 1975 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Joint Family Abolition Act, 1975'). A learned single Judge of this Court in Madhavi Amma v. Kalliani Amma, (1988) 2 Ker LT 964 and a Division Bench of this Court in Bhaskaran v. Kalliani, (1990) 2 Ker LT 749, have taken the view that the above-said Section 17 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 continues to be in force notwithstanding the Joint Family Abolition Act, 1975. It is the correctness of the said decisions that falls for consideration before us.

2. The basic facts are not in dispute and are as follows: The property in question belongs to one Lakshmikutty Amma, who belonged to a Nair family and who died on 18-2-1982 leaving behind her, her husband (plaintiff) and her mother, one Chellamma. The dispute is in regard to the succession to the property held by Lakshmikutty Amma on the date of her death on 18-2-19.82. Her husband is claiming as legal heir under Section 15 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 on the basis that the effect of the Joint Family Abolition Act, 1975 was to make Section 17 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 inoperative. The contest on the other side is raised by defendants 1 to 8 who are the legal heirs of Lakshmikutty Amma's mother, Chellamma, the said Chellamma having died on 8-9-1982 subsequent to Lakshmikutty Amma's death. Defendants 1 to 8 claim that their mother, Chellamma became the legal heir to the property of her daughter by virtue of Section 17 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. They contend that Section 17 continues to be operative even after the passing of the Joint Family Abolition Act, 1975. There is no dispute that the plaintiff married Lakshmikutty Amma in April, 1973 and the defendants 1 to 8 are the brothers and sisters of Lakshmikutty Amma and children of Chellamma. 9th defendant is the paternal uncle of late Lakshmikutty Amma.

3. The suit was filed for a declaration of title by the plaintiff over plaint A Schedule properties except in regard to the building in item 4 of plaint A Schedule and plaint B Schedule amounts deposited in Bank by Lakshmikutty Amma. Admittedly, items 1, 2, 3 and 5 of plaint A Schedule belong to said Lakshmikutty Amma while plaint B Schedule were deposits in her name. Item 4 in the plaint A Schedule is a building in item 3 alleged to have been put up by defendants subsequent to the death of Lakshmikutty Amma while item 2 is a building in item 1 of plaint A Schedule. According to the plaintiff, items 1, 3 and 5 were acquired by deceased Lakshmikutty Amma with the funds supplied by him and the amounts mentioned in plaint B Schedule are deposited by him in the State Bank of India, Changanacherry branch in the name of the deceased and that on her death, defendants 1 to 8 have trespassed into the plaint A Schedule properties. It may be noted that Chellamma had filed OP 71 of 1982 before the Sub Court, Kottayam for grant of a succession certificate in respect of plaint B Schedule amounts. The plaintiff got himself impleaded therein and opposed the said application and the said O.P. was dismissed. Chellamma having subsequently died, defendants 1 to 8 got themselves impleaded as additional petitioners in the said application. While the O.P. was pending, the present suit had been filed by the plaintiff and it was because of the filing of the present suit that the O.P. was dismissed declaring that the said dismissal will be subject to the result of the suit. Though an appeal was filed before the Sub Court against the judgment in the O.P., that was also dismissed reserving the rights of the parties to be governed by the judgment in the suit. As already stated, the plaintiff relied on Section 15 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 while the defendants relied upon Section 17 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956,

4. Defendants have filed a joint written statement contending that the plaint A Schedule items were the self-acquisition of late Lakshmikutty Amma and that plaintiff has not given any money for the acquisition of these properties.

5. The trial Court held that plaint A Schedule items 1, 2, 3 and 5 and the deposits shown in plaint B Schedule were the separate properties of Lakshmikutty Amma and that item 4 of plaint A Schedule was unauthorisedly put up in item 3 by the defendants after the death of Lakshmikutty Amma. The trial Court also held that Section 15 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 applied and that Section 17 was no longer applicable after the passing of the Joint Family Abolition Act, 1975 and that, therefore, Chellamma could not have claimed any right to the property on the death of her daughter Lakshmikutty Amma and that it was the plaintiff who could claim the property. It was, therefore, held that the plaintiff had title to plaint A Schedule items 1, 2, 3 and 5 and in regard to plaint B Schedule amounts as the legal heir of his wife Lakshmikutty Amma and a decree for possession was granted for plaint A and B Schedules. Defendants were directed to remove item 4 of plaint A Schedule within two months from the date of judgment and on failure the plaintiff was allowed to have it removed through the Execution Court at the expenses of the fourth defendant. It is against this judgment that the defendants have preferred this appeal.

6. In this appeal, it is not in dispute that plaint A Schedule properties (except item 4) belong to Lakshmikutty Amma. It is on that basis that we have to consider whether Section 15 would help the plaintiff-respondent or whether Section 17 would help the defendants-appellants.

7. Elaborate arguments have been addressed for the appellants by learned Counsel, Sri M. Krishnan Nair and by counsel for the respondents, Sri C. K. Sivasankara Panicker. As the matter is of considerable importance affecting all those who had been governed by the Marumakkathayam law, we requested other senior members of the Bar to address us if they so desired. Pursuant to our request, Sri Jagadeeshchandran Nair, Sri T. P. Kelu Nambiar and Sri S. Venkatasubramanya Iyer submitted elaborate arguments before us supporting the contention of the appellants that Section 17 continues to operate even after the passing of the Joint Family Abolition Act, 1975. We are thankful to them as also to counsel who appeared in the case for the very valuable assistance given to us.

8. It will be noticed that the Marumakkathayam system of law was applicable in the South-Western coast of India, in areas which have now become part of the State of Kerala and in some parts which are now within the State of Karnataka and the State of Tamil Nadu. What we decide in this case is meant to apply within the State of Kerala inasmuch as the Joint Family Abolition Act, 1975 extends its operation only within the State of Kerala. We shall now set out the contentions of learned Counsel on both sides.

9. It is the contention for the appellants-defendants that Section 17 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, which relates to the succession to a female dying after the commencement of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 and who would have been governed by the Marumakkathayam law had the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 not been passed, continues to be governed by Section 17 and that the abolition of right by birth, right of survival ship, pious obligation etc. and the abolition of the Travancore Nair Act etc. by the Joint Family Abolition Act, 1975 has no bearing on Section 17 of the Hindu Succession Act. It is also agreed that the principle of Incorporation or Reference is not attracted to Section 17 of the Hindu Succession Act. That Section merely referes to the persons who are governed by the Marumakkathayam law on the date of the commencement of the Hindu Succession Act and once that group is identified, they will be governed by Section 17 of the Hindu Succession Act and the Joint Family Abolition Act, 1975 cannot indirectly make Section 17 inoperative. Their contention further is that the Statement of Objects and Reasons and the reports of the State Law Commission which preceded the enactment indicate clearly that the State Legislature while passing the Joint Family Abolition Act, 1975 did not intend to disturb the continued operation of Section 17 of the Hindu Succession Act.

10. On the other hand, it is contended by learned Counsel for the respondent-plaintiff that Section 17 of the Hindu Succession Act must be treated as an express amendment to the Travancore Nair Act and other State enactments dealing with succession and on the repeal of the Travancore Nair Act by Section 7(2) of the Joint Family Abolition Act, 1975, Section 17 gets expressly repealed even otherwise it gets impliedly repealed on the passing of the Joint Family Abolition Act, 1975. Alternatively, the principle of Incorporation or Reference applies to Section 17 of the Hindu Succession Act and that the Marumakkathayam law mentioned in Section 17 must be treated as changing from time to time depending upon whatever changes were brought in the said law by the State Legislature and that once the Joint Family Abolition Act, 1975 was passed, the said Marumakkathayam law came to be totally abolished both under Section 7(1) and Section 7(2) of the said Act, and therefore, Section became inoperative. It is also contended that the Hindu Succession Act and (for example) the Travancore Nair Act (insofar as it relates to succession) are in pari materia or are supplements to each other and, therefore, the effect of the repeal of the Travancore Nair Act (and other laws) has to be carried into Section 17 of the Hindu Succession Act. Once that is done, Section 17 becomes inoperative inasmuch as there is no person, after the passing of the Joint Family Abolition Act, 1975, governed by the Marumakkathayam law. That would make Section 17 of the Hindu Succession Act inoperative.

11. On the basis of the above contentions, the following points arise for consideration :

(1) What are the changes, relevant to the present case, made in the Marumakkathayam law from time to time by the Parliament or by the Kerala State Legislature?

(2) Whether the Kerala State Legislature, when it made a legislation under Entry 5 of List III to the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India by passing the Joint Family Abolition Act, 1975, intended to trench upon Section 17 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 which was a law passed by the Parliament under the same Entry in relation to testamentary and intestate matters?

(3) Whether Section 17 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 incorporates an amendment into the Travancore Nair Act and other Statutes and whether subsequent to the repeal of the Travancore Nair Act and other State laws by the State Legislature and by virtue of Section 7(2) of the Joint Family Abolition Act, 1975, Section 17 of the Hindu Succession Act stands repealed by virtue of the operation of Article 254(2) of the Constitution of India?

(4) Whether Section 17 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 becomes inoperative after the passing of the Joint Family Abolition Act, 1975 and if so, to what categories of persons it applies and to what categories of persons it does not apply?

(5) What is the position of those persons who were born on or after 1-12-1976 when the Joint Family Abolition Act, 1975 came into force?

12. Point No. 1 :-- Under this point, we shall make a brief survey of the changes made in the Marumakkathayam system of inheritance and with particular reference to the facts of this case. We shall, however, extract the relevant statutory provisions while dealing with Point No. 2.

12A. It has to be noticed that the Marumakkathayam system of inheritance means the system of inheritance by descent from a common ancestress. It is called a matrilineal system of inheritance and is somewhat different from the patrilineal system of inheritance in the various branches of Hindu law. Various principles of succession were being applied both when a male died or a female died, in the South-Western parts of this country and these principles of succession were generally treated as Marumakkathayam system of inheritance. Before the States Reorganisation Act of 1956 was passed, several legislations had been made by the Provincial Legislatures both in the former State of Travancore and Cochin and former State of Madras to amend the pristline Marumakkathayam law not only in regard to succession but also in regard to marriage, divorce, joint family management etc. The said Statutes were, therefore, governing the law relating to testamentary and intestate succession among Nairs, Ezhavas and other communities. The Nairs were governed by the Travancore Nair Act, II of 1100 while the Ezhavas were governed by the Travancore Ezhava Act, III of 1100 and so on.

13. In 1955 and 1956 Parliament came forward with four important Statutes governing Hindus, namely, the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955; the Hindu Succession Act, 1956; the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 and the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956. These Acts were passed after considerable debate over several years. So far as the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 was concerned, it contained certain provisions amending or modifying the existing law relating to testamentary and intestate successions which were till then governed by the Travancore Nair Act or the Travancore Ezhava Act etc. For the aforesaid purposes, the Hindu Succession Act introduced a definition of 'Marumakkathayam law' in Section 3(h) and modified the law of succession in certain respects in Sections 7, 17 and 30 of the said Act. While Section 7 related to the devolution in respect of the undivided interest of a person in the property of a tarwad, tavazhee, kutumba, kavaru or illom, Section 17 made a separate provision in relation to succession to property of males or females who would have been governed by the Marumakkathayam law if the Hindu Succession Act had not been passed. So far as succession to females, with which we are concerned, Section 17 stated that provisions of Section 15 relating to succession to a female will have to be applied in the manner mentioned in Section 17(ii). Section 30 of the Act contains an Explanation permitting interest of a member of a tarwad, tavazhi, illom, kutumba or kavaru to be capable of being disposed of by male or female in accordance with the provisions of Indian Succession Act, 1925 or any other law for the time being in force and applicable to Hindus.

14. Taking the example of the present case, it will be noticed that if Lakshmikutty Amma, on her death, was governed by the Hindu Succession Act, her mother would be her legal heir under Section 17(ii)(a) inasmuch as under that clause, the legal heirs of the properties of the females are only the sons and daughters and the mother. In the present case, since Lakshmikutty Amma did not have sons or daughters, the property would go under Section 17(ii)(a) to her mother, Chellamma. Succession to a female on her death under the Travancore Nair Act in a case where the deceased had no male or female children, would have been governed by Section 18 of the Travancore Nair Act. That Section stated that on the death of a Nair female leaving no lineal descendants surviving her, the whole of the self-acquired and separate property left undisposed of by her at her death shall devolve on her mother's tavazhee. Section 2(3) of the Travancore Nair Act had defined ""Thavazhee of a female"" as ""a group of persons consisting of that female and her issue how-low-so-ever in the female line, or such of that group as are alive"". In other words, before the passing of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, if a Nair female died without leaving any male or female lineal descendants surviving her, her property would have gone to her mother and the mother's issues how-low-so-ever in the female line, or such of that group as are alive. This succession was altered under Section 17 of the Hindu Succession Act to the extent that instead of the property devolving on the mother's thavazhee, it would devolve on the mother alone.

15. We can notice that the other sub Sections of Section 17 brought about similar changes in the law of succession mentioned in the Travancore Nair Act and other laws in relation to succession to males or females who died after the commencement of the Hindu Succession Act and who were, before the said Act, governed by the Marumakkathayam law of succession as specified in the Travancore Nair Act. The question before us is whether upon the passing of the Joint Family Abolition Act, 1975, Section 17 of the Hindu Succession Act stood either repealed expressly or on account of repugnancy or on account of its becoming inoperative. We think that the aforesaid discussion of the general changes made in the Marumakkathayam system of inheritance will be sufficient to understand our discussion under Points 2 to 5. Point No. 1 is decided accordingly.

16. Point No. 2:-- As stated earlier, Lakshmikutty Amma, in the present case, belong to a Nair family. The dispute is in relation to succession to her property on her death on 18-2-1982. The question depends upon whether Section 17 of the Hindu Succession Act applies or whether the said Section has become repugnant on the passing of the Kerala Joint Hindu Family system (Abolition) Act, 1975, in view of Article. 254(2) of the Constitution of India. For the purpose of deciding that question, it is necessary to refer to the relevant statutory provisions contained in the Travancore Nair Act (Regulation II of 1100), the relevant provisions of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 and the relevant provisions of the Kerala Joint Hindu Family System (Abolition) Act, 1975.

17. As stated in Point No, 1, at one point of time, the succession was governed by pristine Marumakkathayam law. Subsequently, the succession came to be governed by the Travancore Nair Act (Regulation II of 1100). That Act dealt with the following subjects : marriage and its dissolution (Chapter II), maintenance and guardianship (Chapter III), intestate succession (Chapter IV), testamentary succession (Chapter V), the tarwad and its management (Chapter VI), partition of tarwad property (Chapter VII) and impartible tarwads (Chapter VIII). Chapter I dealt with definitions. Section 1(2) stated that the Travancore Nair Act would apply to all Nairs domiciled in Travancore, and to such Nairs not so domiciled and non-Nairs, whether so domiciled or not, as have, or shall have, marital relation with Nairs domiciled in Travancore. Section 2(2) defines 'marumakkathayam' as the system of inheritance in which descent is traced in the female line. Chapter IV which dealt with intestate succession contained Sections 11 to 22. Intestate succession on the death of a Nair male was governed by Sections 11 to 16. Intestate succession on the death of a female member of a Nair family was governed by Sections 17 to 20. Sections 21 to 23 dealt with certain other connected matters relating to succession. Testamentary succession in Chapter V was governed by a single Section , that is Section 24. There was a saving provision in Section 44 in Chapter IX dealing with supplemental provisions, which reads as follows :

""44. Nothing in this Regulation shall --

(a) affect the existing rules of marumakkathayam law, custom or usage except to the extent hereinbefore expressly provided for; or .....""

From the provisions of the above Travancore Nair Act, it is clear that the said Act made provisions in regard to marriage and its dissolution, maintenance and guardianship, intestate succession, testamentary succession, tarwad and its management, partition of tarwad property and impartible tarwads. It also provided in Section 44 that the rule of Marumakkathayam law, custom, usage, except to the extent hereinbefore expressly provided for, would be saved.

18. After the commencement of the Constitution of India, provisions were made in the Concurrent List (List III) permitting Parliament or the State Legislature to make various laws in regard to intestate succession and also certain other matters. It is necessary to refer to Entry 5 of List III of the 7th Schedule to the Constitution of India, which reads as follows :

""Marriage and divorce; infants and minors; adoption; Wills, intestacy and succession; joint family and partition; all matters in respect of which parties in judicial proceedings were immediately before the commencement of this Constitution subject to their personal law.""

So far as ""Wills, intestacy and succession"" are concerned, Parliament passed the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. The said Act came into force with effect from 18-6-1956. Section 2 of the said Act stated that the said Act would apply to any person, who is a Hindu by religion in any of its forms or developments, including a Virashaiva, a Lingayat or a follower of the Brahmo, Prarthana or Arya Samaj, and to any person who is a Buddhist, Jains or Sikh by religion, and to any other person who is not a Muslim, Christian, Parsi or Jew by religion, unless it was proved that any such person would not have been governed by the Hindu law or by any custom or usage as part of that law in respect of any of the matters dealt with herein if this Act had not been passed. Section 3(h) defines 'Marumakkathayam law' as follows :

""3(h): ""Marumakkathayam law"" means the system of law applicable to persons --

(a) who if this Act had not been passed, would have been governed by the Madras Marumakkathayam Act, 1932 (Madras Act XXII of 1933); the Travancore Nair Act (II of 1100 K); the Tranvancore Ezhava Act (III of 1100 K); the Travancore Nanjined Vellala Act (VI of 1101 K); the Travancore Kshatriya Act (VII of 1108 K ); the Travancore Krishnanaka Marumakkathayee Act (VII of 1115 K); the Cochin Marumaskkatham Act (XXXIII of 1113 K); or the Cochin Nair Act (XXIX of 1113 K) with respect to the matters for which provision is made in this Act, or

(b) who belong to any community, the members of which are largely domiciled in the State of Travancore-Cochin or Madras, as it existed immediately before the 1st November, 1956 and who, if this Act had not been passed, would have been governed with respect to the matters for which provision is made in this Act by any system of inheritance in which descent is traced through the female line; but does not include the aliyasanthana law.""

Section 4 of the Hindu Succession Act has an overriding effect of the said Act and reads as follows:

""4. Overriding effect of Act: (1) Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act --

(a) any text, rule or interpretation of Hindu law or any custom or usage as part of that law in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall cease to have effect with respect to any matter for which provision is made in this Act;

(b) any other law in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall cease to apply to Hindus so far as it is inconsistent with any of the provisions contained in this Act.""

Section 7 deals with devolution of interest in the property of a tarwed, tavazhi, kavaru or illom. It is necessary to extract Section 7(1) which reads as follows ;

""7. Devolution of interest in the property of a tarwed, tavazhi, kutumba, kavaru or illom:--

(1) When a Hindu, to whom the marumakkathayam or nambudiri law would have applied if this act had not been passed, dies after the commencement of this Act, having at the time of his or her death an interest in the property of a tarwad, tawazhi or illom, as the case may be, his or her interest in the property shall devolve by testamentary or intestate succession, as the case may be, under this Act and not according to the marumakkatayam or nambudiri law.

Secrtion 15 of the Hindu Succession Act deals with general rules of succession in the case of female Hindus, and it reads as follows :

""15. General rules of succession in the case of female Hindu dying intestate shall devolve according to the rules set out in Section 16 --

(a) firstly, upon the sons and daughters (including the children of any predeceased son or daughter) and the husband;

(b) secondly, upon the heirs of the husband;

(c) thirdly, upon the mother and father;

(d) fourthly, upon the heirs of the father;

(e) lastly, upon the heirs of the mother;

.....""

Section 17 with which we are concerned now reads as follows.

""17. Special provisions respecting persons governed by marumakkathayam and aliyasantana laws. -- The provisions of Sections 8, 10, 15 and 23 shall have effect in relation to persons who would have been governed by the marumakkathayam law or aliyasantana law if this Act had not been passed as if --

(i) for Sub-clauses (c) and (d) of Section 8, the following had been substituted, namely:--

'(c) thirdly, if there is no heir of the two classes then upon his relatives, whether agnates or cognates'.

(ii) for Clauses (a) to (e) of Sub- Section (i) of Section 15, the following had been substituted, namely:--

(a) firstly, upon the sons and daughters (including the children of any pre-deceased son of daughter and the mother;

(b) secondly, upon the father and the husband;

(c) thirdly, upon the heirs of the mother;

(d) fourthly, upon the heirs of the father; and

(e) lastly, upon the heirs of the husband;

(iii) Clause (a) of Sub- Section (2) of Section 15 had been omitted.

(iv) Section 23 had been omitted.""

So far as testamentary succession is concerned, the same is governed by Section 30 of the Hindu Succession Act, which reads as follows :

""30. Testamentary succession. -- Any Hindu may dispose of by will or other testamentary disposition any property, which is capable of being so disposed of by him in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 (39 of 1925), or any other law for the time being in force and applicable to Hindus.

Explanation. -- The interest of a male Hindu in a Mitakshara Coparcenary property or the interest of a member of a tarwad, tawazhi, Illom, Kutumba or kavaru in the property of the tarwad, tawazhi, illom, kutumba or kavaru shall notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, or in any other law for the time being in force, be deemed to be property capable of being disposed of by him or by her within the meaning of this Section .""",fm
"AMITAVA ROY, J.

The appeals assail the judgment and order dated 11.6.2012, rendered by the High Court of Uttrakhand, Nainital in Criminal Appeal No. 111 of 2004, affirming the conviction of the appellants under Sections 302,364 r/w 34 IPC. For the offence under Section 302 r/w 34 IPC, the appellants have been sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and fine of Rs. 5000/- each and for the offence under Section 364 r/w 34 IPC, they have been sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for seven years and fine of Rs. 5000/- each. Sentence of imprisonment in default of fine has also been awarded. The trial court had convicted and sentenced the appellants in identical terms.

2. We have heard Mr. V. Shekhar, learned senior counsel for the appellants â Chaman and Sukhbeer in Criminal Appeal No. 365 of 2013, Mr. P.K. Dey, learned counsel for the appellant â Rakesh Kumar @ Mota in Criminal Appeal No. 597 of 2013 and Mr. Jatinder Kumar Bhatia, learned counsel for the State.

3. The genesis of the prosecution case is traceable to the F.I.R. lodged on 12.6.1996 by Rajo Devi, widow of the deceased Jagram, addressed to the Station In-charge, Police Station Cleamantown, Dehradun. She alleged in the FIR that prior to the date of incident i.e. 12.6.1996, the appellants Chaman, Rakesh @ Mota and Sukhbeer along with two associates had come to their residence in search of her son Vinod, who they alleged was involved in the murder of the son of Chaman. As Vinod was not available there, they went back. They returned on the date of the incident at about 11 A.M., when she along with her husband and daughters Bina and Manju were present in the house. The appellants again enquired about Vinod and as he was not present in the house, they took away her husband Jagram with them. The informant stated that the appellants had come in a jeep bearing No. UP 015 5330 and had forced her husband in the said jeep and had taken him away. She expressed apprehension that due to the impression of the appellants that her son Vinod was involved in the murder of the son of Chaman, they would eliminate her husband, Jagram. She mentioned as well in the FIR that at the time of the incident, her daughters Bina and Manju raised alarm, but the people of the locality did not intervene.

4. This information was registered as FIR No. 250 of 1996 and in course of the investigation, on 15.6.1996 at about 1400 hours, one Amar Singh informed the Police Station Chandpur, District Bijnour that a decomposed dead body, 3/4 days old, had been detected in a jungle between Cehla and Ismailpur. This information was recorded and inquest of the dead body was conducted in presence of panch witnesses, whereafter the body was dispatched for post-mortem examination. At that stage, the dead body was unidentified. It was found to be decomposed with maggots. No visible injury was noticed on the dead body. The appellant Chaman was arrested on 3.7.1996, who thereafter led the police to the jungle at Village Cehla, within the jurisdiction of P.S. Chandpur, District Bijnour from where a rope, as shown by him, was recovered from bamboo bushes. According to the prosecution, the appellant Chaman also showed to the police, the place in the jungle where Jagram had been killed by hanging him by that rope from a tree. The rope was seized vide recovery memo and the site plan of the place of occurrence as indicated by the appellant Chaman, was prepared.

5. The dead body, on the completion of inquest, was sealed and was brought to the District Hospital, Bijnour for autopsy. On the basis of the evidence collected in the course of investigation, charge-sheet was submitted against the appellants â Chaman, Rakesh Kumar @ Mota, Sukhbeer, Ghanshyam @ Bundu, Tofique and Ashok under Sections 302/364/201 IPC. The case being exclusively triable by the Court of Sessions was committed to the Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Fast Track (IV), Dehradun. Charge was framed under Sections 147, 201/302/364 r/w 149 IPC, to which the accused persons pleaded ânot guiltyâ and claimed to be tried.

6. The prosecution examined ten witnesses, whereafter the statements of the accused persons were recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C.. All of them stood by their denial in their statements. On the conclusion of the trial, the trial court acquitted accused Ghanshyam, Tofique and Ashok of all the charges. It acquitted appellants as well, of the charges under Sections 147, 201 r/w 149 IPC but convicted them, under Sections 302/364 r/w 34 IPC and sentenced them as above.

7. The High Court, by the verdict impugned, affirmed the sentence and conviction recorded by the trial court.

8. Mr. Shekhar, learned senior counsel for the appellants- Chaman and Sukhbeer has at the threshold dismissed the case of the prosecution as motivated and concocted and to buttress this plea, has drawn the attention of the Court to a letter dated 15.4.1996, addressed by one Surender @ Baniya, a detenue in District Jail, Bijnour to the Superintendent of Police, Bijnour, U.P. hinting at a plot to kill, the appellant Chaman who is a witness in the case of the murder of his son. The learned senior counsel sought to impress upon the court on the basis of this document, that the appellant Chaman in particular, was thus falsely implicated in the case of alleged abduction and murder of Jagram. Apart from emphatically contending that there was an apparent confusion in the information as to the type of the vehicle in which the appellants had visited her house, Mr. Shekhar has endeavoured to discredit the prosecution case, for the omission to examine the scribe of the FIR, who admittedly had penned the same on the disclosures of the informant Rajo Devi. According to the learned senior counsel, the discrepancy in the description of the rope allegedly recovered, being led thereto by the appellant Chaman and the one produced in the court, did conclusively belie the prosecution case.

9. Mr. Shekhar laboured to emphasise that this anomaly is writ large from the testimony of PW4, Constable Nardev Singh who identified the rope produced in the court to be made of plastic whereas PW10 S.I. Ramesh Chander Sharma, the Investigation Officer in categorical terms, had deposed that the seized rope was made of jute and that it was not a nylon rope. Mr. Shekhar further urged, that admittedly though the dead body was decomposed and some portions of the abdomen and lower half were missing, no visible injury was noticed thereon and particularly on the neck and thus the prosecution version of death by asphyxia, as opined by the doctor, effected by the rope recovered, was wholly untrustworthy. The learned senior counsel, while questioning the identification of the appellants, has also cast aside the prosecution case to be wholly improbable as well.

10. While generally endorsing the above contentions, Mr. P.K. Dey, learned counsel for the appellant Rakesh Kumar @ Mota, has urged that the FIR, lodged within 45 minutes of the incident, is too prompt in point of time, having regard to the nature of the incident complained of and in reality is ante timed to falsely implicate the appellant âRakesh Kumar in the case. According to the learned counsel, not only the prosecution case is inherently unbelievable, in absence of any endeavour whatsoever by the family members to resist the alleged abduction of Jagram and the non- intervention of residents of the otherwise densely populated neighbourhood, the acquittal of the three co-accused, who allegedly had accompanied the appellant, is destructive of the sub stratum of the prosecution case. This is more so, as the accused-appellant and their companions were unarmed. Mr. Dey has argued, that not only the discrepancy in the description of the rope recovered and produced in the court, renders the prosecution case highly doubtful, in absence of identification of the dead body and any perceptible nexus between the offence of murder of Jagram and the appellants, their conviction, if sustained, would be a travesty of justice. The learned counsel underlined the contradictions in the statements of PW6, the Doctor and PW5-Rakesh about the state of the body before the autopsy and also maintained that in absence of any evidence of coordination between the police stations at Dehradun and Bijnour over the detection of the dead body, the despath thereof and its identification, the prosecution could not establish that the dead body was that of Jagram. Inviting the attention of this Court to the evidence of PW5- Rakesh, the son of the deceased who stated to have come to learn about the abduction of his father 4/5 days prior to the recovery of the dead body, the learned counsel has insisted that such a statement being a part of the same transaction enfolding the alleged abduction of the deceased and recovery of the dead body, it is res gestae and thus demolished the version in the FIR as well as the testimony of the informant to that effect. Mr. Dey has urged as well that as the factum of the identification of the dead body to be of Jagram, as made by his son PW5 Vinod, had not been put to the appellants, in the course of their statements under Section 313 Cr.P.C., this incriminating circumstance could not have been taken note of and acted upon in support of the charge.

11. Per contra, learned counsel for the State has maintained that the testimony of PW1âRajo Devi, the informant, PW2- Manju, the daughter of the deceased, PW4 Constable Nardev Singh, the seizure witness of the rope, PW5 Rakesh, son of the deceased who identified the dead body, PW6 Dr. A.K. Kaul who had performed the post-mortem examination and PW10 S.I. Ramesh Chander Sharma in particular has proved the charge against the appellants beyond all reasonable doubt and thus the conviction and sentence as recorded by the trial court and affirmed by the High Court does not merit any interference.

12. The learned counsel for the State has asserted that as the abduction of the deceased has been convincibly proved by PWs 1 and 2 and that Jagram had met a homicidal death immediately thereafter, there was a rebuttable presumption of guilt against the appellants and as they had failed to offer any explanation whatsoever, as to how they had dealt with Jagram while he was in their custody, their conviction is sustainable in law and on facts. He referred, in particular to Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 to reinforce this plea and also relied upon the decision of this Court in State of State of W.B. vs. Mir Mohammad Omar and others, (2000) 8 SCC 382.

13. The arguments advanced and the materials on record have received our due attention. Concurrent findings of facts, notwithstanding, having regard to the conviction and sentence as recorded, we have traversed the evidence available to the extent essential for the present adjudication.

14. The facts narrated in the FIR dated 12.6.1996, in our estimate, are of sufficient clarity regarding the dual visits of the appellants to the house of the deceased in search of his son Vinod. The contents thereof do not admit any doubt that the appellants along with two others had come in a jeep, the number whereof had been provided in the FIR, on the date of the incident at about 11 A.M. and had taken away with them the deceased, father of Vinod in presence of the informant- Rajo Devi, his daughters Bina and Manju. There is a clear averment that though the daughters raised alarm and that the people of the locality were present, no body did come forward to prevent the abduction. The omission on the part of the people in the neighbourhood to intervene per se, in our opinion, does not detract from the truthfulness of the report made which admittedly had been done within the shortest possible time. Though the FIR was written by one H.S. Verma, his non-examination as well is of no adverse bearing on the prosecution case. The letter by Surender, a detenu in the District Jail, Bijnour hinting at the plot to kill Chaman also, in our comprehension, is not of any definitive significance.

15. PW1-Rajo Devi, in unequivocable terms, stated on oath that on the date of the incident at 11 A.M., the appellants and two other persons, whose names were not known to her, had come in a car with curtains. They searched for her son Vinod and when he was not found, they picked up her husband Jagram, pushed him in the car and took him away. She identified the appellants and other accused persons in the court to be the kidnappers of her husband. She stated as well, in terms of the FIR filed, that the appellants had visited her house 15 days prior to the date of the incident looking for her son Vinod, disclosing it to her that they suspected that he was involved in the murder of the son of Chaman. The witness also deposed that thereafter she along with her two daughters Bina and Manju and son-in- law, had visited the Bijnour mortuary and had identified the dead body of her husband.

16. PW2- Manju, daughter of the deceased testified in the same lines as of her mother. She identified the appellants who along with two others had come in a car to their house on the date of the incident. She reiterated the purpose of the visit of the appellants and their companions as disclosed by them and confirmed that they had similarly come to their house in search of Vinod 15 days prior to the date of incident. She mentioned about the presence of her sister Veena in the house at the time of the incident. She was categorical in the matter of identification of the accused persons.

17. PW4 Constable Nardev Singh deposed that the appellant Chaman led the police to recover the rope whereby Jagram was hung from the tree. He stated that the appellant Chaman not only identified the tree but also led the police to the rope which was recovered from the bush in the jungle. He identified the rope in the court to be one of plastic. In cross- examination, this witness clarified that the jungle was not on a thorough fare. He stated that he was unaware as to why in his statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C., the recovered rope was described to be a âjute ropeâ (suthli).

18. PW5 Rakesh, son of the deceased on oath deposed that he recognized the dead body of his father at District Hospital Mortuary, Bijnour, after it was taken out from the sealed cloth before the post-mortem examination. He stated that he came to know about 4/5 days before, that appellant Chaman had called his father and had taken him away.

19. PW6 Dr. A.K. Kaul who had performed the autopsy, testified that the dead body was then in an advanced stage of decomposition and maggots were present on it. He stated that some body parts like middle stomach and left thigh were missing and that it appeared that it had been nibbled by animals. He mentioned that there was no apparent injuries on the dead body of the deceased but opined that the cause of death might be asphyxia. He stated as well that there was no mark of rope on the body but added that bronchial tube was broken. According to him, death had occurred between 12.6.1996 to 15.6.1996.

20. PW7 Shakoor Khan was a witness to the recovery and inquest of the dead body. PW8 S.I. Charan Singh had prepared the inquest report of the dead body. PW9 Amar Singh had detected the dead body of an unknown person lying in the jungle between Cehla and Ismailpur. The dead body was 3/4 days old and he had informed of this fact in writing to the Police Station Chandpur.

21. PW10 S.I. Ramesh Chander Sharma, the Investigating Officer narrated the steps taken by him in the course of investigation. He stated about the recovery of the rope from the bamboo bushes of the place of occurrence, being led thereto by appellant Chaman and the preparation of the memo of seizure thereof. He admitted in his cross-examination that the place from where the rope was recovered was accessible to all. He mentioned that the rope recovered was a jute rope and not a nylon rope.

22. A perusal of the statements of the accused persons recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C. reveal that comprehensive questions pertaining to abduction and murder of Jagram by them, detection of his decomposed dead body, post-mortem thereof with the cause of death and the recorded statement of appellant Chaman leading to the discovery of the rope involved, were put to them so as to fully enable them to explain all the incriminating circumstances appearing against them in the evidence adduced by the prosecution.

23. An analytical evaluation of the materials on record does not admit of any doubt of the successive visits of the appellants on the turn of 15 days to the house of the deceased in search of Vinod whom they suspected was involved in the murder of the son of the appellant Chaman. There is nothing to disbelieve PWs 1 and 2 that the appellants, on the date of the incident, had come in a jeep and as they did not find Vinod in the house, they abducted Jagram, who was later on found dead within 3/4 days therefrom in a nearby jungle. Though the incident took place in the broad day light and the daughters did raise alarm, the mere non-intervention by the persons in the locality, in our opinion, in the face of the otherwise overwhelming and consistent testimony of the mother and the daughter does not discredit the prosecution case. Noticeably, the PWs 1 and 2 were steadfast in the matter of identification of the three appellants, not only at the time of the incident but also thereafter in court. According to them, the appellants were of the village Ismailpur and thus their identification was not difficult for them. Admittedly the FIR was lodged with due promptness, thus obviating the possibility of any embellishment. To reiterate, non-examination of the scribe of FIR does not render the prosecution case untrustworthy in the attendant facts and circumstances.

24. The irrefutably proved circumstance against the appellants is that they had visited the house of the deceased twice within a span of fifteen days, on each occasion in search of his son Vinod and ultimately on the date of the incident had forcibly taken him away, only thereafter to be found to have died a homicidal death in an unnatural setting. The fact of recovery of the rope, being led thereto by the appellant Chaman is admissible in evidence against the appellants. The discrepancy about the texture of the rope, the seizure thereof having otherwise been proved, is not of much significance. PW4 Constable Nardev Singh, who was associated with the procedure of seizure of the rope had identified the same in the court. In our opinion, nothing much turns on the mismatch in the description thereof as has been sought to be emphasised on the basis of his statement to this effect under Section 161 Cr.P.C. The dead body has been identified by the informant wife in presence of her daughters and sons-in- law as well as the son PW5 as is evident from the evidence on record.

25. The motive for the offence is also discernible in the facts of this case and for that matter, from the disclosures made by the appellants for their visits in search of Vinod, who they believed, was involved in the murder of the son of the appellant Chaman. The pleas based on res gestae and the perceived omission to bring to the notice of the appellants, the factum of identification of the dead body, in the face of the consistent, cogent and coherent evidence on record, do not commend for acceptance. The statement of PW2 that he came to know about the abduction after 4/5 days can by no means be one in course of the transaction encompassing the incident to attract the doctrine of res gestae.

26. Significantly, the proved abduction of the deceased from his house by the appellants is per se a criminal offence and carries with it a much higher degree of sinister culpability compared to any phenomenon of âlast seen togetherâ, simpliciter. Further the deceased being in the custody of the appellants after his abduction on 12.6.1996, it was within their special knowledge as to how he had been dealt with by them thereafter before his dead body was found in a decomposed state in a nearby jungle. No explanation is forthcoming in any form in this regard from the appellants.

27. This Court in State of West Bengal (supra) in a somewhat similar fact situation, where the deceased was abducted by the accused persons and thereafter his mangled body was found, held that the pristine rule that the burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused should not be taken as a fossilised doctrine as if it admits of no process of intelligent reasoning. It was enunciated that the doctrine of presumption is not alien to the above rule, nor would it impair the temper of the rule qua the purport of presumption of fact as a rule in the law of evidence. It was observed thus:

âPresumption of fact is an inference as to the existence of one fact from the existence of some other facts, unless the truth of such inference is disproved. Presumption of fact is a rule in law of evidence that a fact otherwise doubtful may be inferred from certain other proved facts. When inferring the existence of a fact from other set of proved facts, the court exercises a process of reasoning and reaches a logical conclusion as the most probable position. The above principle has gained legislative recognition in India when Section 114 is incorporated in the Evidence Act. It empowers the court to presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened. In that process the court shall have regard to the common course of natural events, human conduct etc. in relation to the facts of the case.â

28. Adverting to the facts, this Court ruled that as the prosecution had succeeded in establishing that the deceased had been abducted by the accused, they alone knew what happened to him until he was with them and if he was found murdered in a short time, after the abduction, the permitted reasoning process would enable the court to draw the presumption that the accused had murdered him. It was held that such inference can be disrupted, if the accused would tell the Court what else had happened to the deceased at least until he was in their custody.

29. Referring to Section 106 of the Evidence Act, it was propounded that the said section was not intended to relieve the prosecution of its burden to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, but would apply to cases where prosecution had succeeded in proving facts from which a reasonable inference could be drawn regarding the existence of certain other facts, unless the accused, by virtue of his special knowledge regarding such facts, succeed to offer any explanation, to drive the court to draw a different inference.

30. The following observations by this Court in the context of above legal provision in Shambhu Nath Mehra vs. State of Ajmer AIR 1956 SC 404 was adverted to with approval.

âThis lays down the general rule that in a criminal case the burden of proof is on the prosecution and Section 106 is certainly not intended to relive it of that duty. On the contrary, it is designed to meet certain exceptional cases in which it would be impossible, or at any rate disproportionately difficult for the prosecution to establish facts which are âespeciallyâ within the knowledge of the accused and which he could prove without difficulty or inconvenience. The word âespeciallyâ stresses that it means facts that are pre-eminently or exceptionally within his knowledge.â

31. Proof beyond reasonable doubt, as has been held in a plethora of decisions of this Court, is only a guideline and not a fetish and that someone, who is guilty, cannot get away with impunity only because truth may suffer some infirmity when projected through human processes as has been observed in Inder Singh and another vs. The State (Delhi Administration) (1978)4SCC161. A caveat against exaggerated devotion to the rule of benefit of doubt to nurture fanciful doubts or lingering suspicion so as to destroy social defence has been sounded by this Court in Gurbachan Singh vs. Satpal Singh and others (1990)1SCC 445. It has been propounded that reasonable doubt is simply that degree of doubt which would permit a reasonable and a just man to come to a conclusion. It has been underlined therein that reasonableness of doubt must be commensurate to the nature of the offence to be investigated.

32. Judged by the above touchstone of reasonableness of doubt in evaluating the facts and circumstances of the present case, we are clear in our mind that the complicity of the appellants in the offences with which they have been charged, has been convincingly proved as required in law.

33. It is patent from the evidence of the doctor conducting the post- mortem examination that the cause of death is asphyxia. PW6 â Dr. A.K. Kaul has indicated as well in his statement on oath that the bronchial tube of the deceased was broken. Having regard to the decomposed state of the dead body, at the time when the post-mortem was conducted, the absence of visible injury on the body per se does not militate against the otherwise unambiguous medical opinion that the death was due to asphyxia. Breaking of bronchial tube is understandably a finding in endorsement of the above cause of death. Absence of visible injuries on the dead body, therefore as such, does not cast any doubt about the homicidal death of Jagram. This is also authenticated by the medical opinion that death had occurred between 12.6.1996 and 15.6.1996, i.e. during the interval between the abduction of the deceased and the detection of his dead body.

34. On a anxious consideration of the entire gamut of the facts of the case and the principles of law evolved, we are, thus of the unhesitant opinion that the concurrent convictions and the sentences based thereon, as recorded by the trial court and the High Court, do not warrant any interference in the present appeals. The appeals are, thus dismissed.",lb
"HEMANT GUPTA, J.

1. The challenge in the present appeal is to an order passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay on 21 st January, 2014 whereby the writ petition filed by M/s. Wockhardt Ltd. 1 was allowed and the order passed by the Industrial Court on 6 th August, 2012 was set aside.

2. The High Court held that the transfer of the appellant 2 was as per the terms and conditions of employment. It was held that the employer had to decide who should work at particular place and who was to be transferred to another place in the interest of 1 for short, âemployerâ 2 for short, âemployeeâ  establishment. It was also held that the employee had failed to challenge the termination order dated 15th April, 2005.

3. Brief facts leading to the present appeal are that the employee was appointed on 6th June, 1985 as a Professional Service Representative and was posted at Sagar, Madhya Pradesh. Thereafter, he was promoted to Field Sales Officer Grade FM-One. One of the conditions in the letter of appointment was that the employer shall be entitled, at any time during the course of employment, to transfer the employee to any of its affiliates, subsidiaries or sister companies. The employee was transferred to Mumbai on 21st March, 2005 with immediate effect. The employee did not join duty at Mumbai; therefore, reminders were sent by the employer on 1st April, 2005 and 8th April, 2005. The service of the employee was terminated on 15th April, 2005.

4. The employee along with National Federation of Sales Representativesâ Union3 filed a complaint on 30 th April, 2005 before the Industrial Court, Maharashtra established under the Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention of Unfair Labour Practices Act, 19714. The allegation of the employee is that he had reasonable and bona fide apprehension that the employer, after filing of the present complaint, was going to take adverse actions such as mala fide transfers, suspension, disciplinary actions, summary terminations etc. against N.P. Mishra, Rajendra 3 for short, âUnionâ 4 for short, âActâ Khandelwal, Sandeep Mitra, Manoj Bhatt, Rajaram V. Baliga and Rajkumar Jasnani. The employee has alleged that the basis of apprehended action against the employees mentioned by him was that they have filed affidavits in his favour against unfair labour practices, high handed actions, atrocities etc. committed by employer company and its employer on 15th March, 2005 during the Launching Conference at Ahmedabad. The employee alleged that he was the President of Sagar Unit of Madhya Pradesh Medical Representativesâ Association which is affiliated to complainant No. 1 i.e. the Union. The employee also alleged that one Mr. Ashish Khare, an active member of the Union was forced to resign from the employment of the employer company in January, 2005 but the same was not accepted. He was paid wages till February, 2005. He was invited for a Launching Conference but two managers of the employer company Deepak Sethi, Sales Manager and Sanjay Anand, Regional Manager drove Mr. Ashish Khare out of the hotel at night time. The employee had protested against the same and it is on account of raising his voice against the said atrocities and acts of force, the employee was threatened that he would be transferred and his other colleagues would also be dealt with severely by the employer. Soon after the Conference was over, the employee was transferred on 21st March, 2005. Such transfer order was received on 4th April, 2005. The employee alleged that his transfer was unjust, unfair, illegal, improper, arbitrary and mala fide, amounting to unfair labour practices under Item 3, 7, 9 and 10  of Schedule IV of the Act. It may be noticed at this stage that the complaint was filed against the company and its General Manager (HR) in its official capacity. Relevant assertion in the complaint reads as under:

â(iii) That the impugned transfer order does not mention any business exigency and/or administrative reason/s and, in fact, there does not exist any business exigency and/or administrative reason/s for suddenly transferring the Complainant No. 2 from Sagar (Madhya Pradesh) to Mumbai (State of Maharashtra) because there are sufficient number of Medical Representatives working in Mumbai. Thus, there is no business exigency or administrative reason for transferring the Complainant No. 2 from Sagar (Madhya Pradesh) to Mumbai (State of Maharashtra). The impugned transfer of the Complainant No. 2 is, therefore, malafide transfer and thereby the Respondents are engaging in the unfair labour practices under Item 3 of Schedule IV of the M.R.T.U. & P.U.L.P. Act, 1971.â
5. In the written statement filed by the employer, the status of the employee as a workman was denied as he was alleged to be working in supervisory, managerial or administrative capacity and he was discharging his duties as Territory Manager. The stand of the employer was that the transfer was as per contract of employment signed between the parties and that there is no mala fide in the order of transfer. It was also pleaded that services of the employee stood terminated on 15th April, 2005 and on the date of filing of the complaint, the employee was not in the employment of the respondent employer, therefore, no complaint of unfair labour practices can be entertained in law. It was also asserted that the  employee had failed to report for duties at the transferred place, therefore, communications dated 1st April, 2005 and 8th April, 2005 were addressed to him to resume duties but the employee continued his defiant attitude of not reporting for work at the transferred place and subsequently, his services were terminated on 15th April, 2005. It was also pleaded that the Industrial Court did not have any jurisdiction to return findings on the issue of termination in a complaint filed under Item 3, 7, 9 and 10 of Schedule IV of the Act. It was also pleaded that there was no Sagar Unit of Madhya Pradesh Medical Representativesâ Association as per the information of the employer. Further, it was pleaded that the resignation of Mr. Ashish Khare was voluntary which was accepted and he was relieved on 6th January, 2005. It was further pleaded that Mr. Khare came to the Conference without an invitation in a clandestine manner. It was also stated that transfer of the employee was discussed by the employer much prior to the actual issuance of the order of transfer. It was also mentioned that the employee had failed to submit his expense statements for the months of February and March, 2005 and, therefore, it was not possible to make payments of salary to the employee.

6. The Industrial Court examined four issues. The first being whether the employee was a workman under Section 2(s) of the Industrial Dispute Act, 1947 read with Section 3(5) of the Act. The second issue being whether the termination order dated 15 th April, 2005  was real, existent and bona fide. The third, whether the employer had indulged in unfair labour practices under the Act. The last issue being whether the employee was entitled to the reliefs claimed.

7. In support of the complaint, the employee filed his affidavit in evidence reiterating the version given by him in his complaint. However, in respect of termination alleged by the employer, the employee stated to the following effect:

â9. I say that the company had addressed me an E-Mail dated 14th April, 2005, inter alia asking me to report for work at Mumbai. I say that a copy of the said E-Mail is filed by me along with my Application dated April 14, 2005, with Application dated 27th July, 2006. I say that I have never received any termination letter dated 15.4.2005 either by courier or by UPC or by any other mode of communication. I say that the purported letter of termination dated 15.4.2005 is not real, existent and bona fide. I say that it is fake and bogus termination letter.â
8. The employee in his cross-examination, as a witness, conducted on 4th June, 2009, admitted that there was no Union by the name Madhya Pradesh Medical and Sales Representativesâ Association.

9. Mr. Raj Kumar Chadha furnished his affidavit in evidence on behalf of the employer. In cross-examination, he deposed that the Employer communicated to the employee that he must report at  the reported place. Since the employee had failed to report on duty, his services stood terminated. Relevant extract of the cross- examination of the witness of the employer is reproduced hereunder:

âWith respect to his telegram claiming sick leave w.e.f. 02/04/2005, I say he was communicated by the management that only if he first reports at transferred place can it be considered, and hence was not granted. I say thereafter the services of Mr. Rajneesh Jagannath Khajoria stood terminated vide companyâs letter dated 15.4.2005. I say the transfer order and the termination letter contents are true and I identify the signatures therein.â
10. With the said factual background, we find that the following questions arise for consideration:

(i) Whether the employee is entitled to dispute the termination order dated 15th April, 2005 as not real or bona fide for the reason that it was not received by him?

(ii) Whether the employee is entitled to dispute his transfer as unfair labour practice in terms of Item 3 of Schedule IV of the Act without impleading the person who is said to have acted in a mala fide manner?

(iii) Whether the question of malice in law can be inferred in the matter of transfer of an employee as unfair labour practice?

(iv) Whether the order of termination is ancillary to the order  of transfer which confers jurisdiction on the Industrial Court to exercise jurisdiction in the matter arising out of allegation of unfair labour practice?

11. Before we proceed further, relevant statutory provisions from the Act need to be reproduced hereunder:

3. To transfer an employee mala fide from one place to another, under the guise of following management policy.â

12. The termination order is said to be fake, bogus and not real or bona fide for the reason that the employee never received any termination letter either by courier, UPC or by any other mode of communication. The statement of the witness of the employer is  that the transfer order and termination letter are true. He has identified the signatures of the authorised representative on such documents as well. Therefore, it is not possible to accept the argument that the termination order is not in existence as the statement of the employer witness has not been challenged. The only allegation is that the employee has not received the termination letter. This Court in a judgment reported as State of Punjab v. Khemi Ram5 held that once the order is issued and sent out to the concerned government servant, it must be held to have been communicated to him, no matter when he actually received it. This Court held as under:

â17. The question then is whether communicating the order means its actual receipt by the concerned government servant. The order of suspension in question was published in the Gazette though that was after the date when the respondent was to retire. But the point is whether it was communicated to him before that date. The ordinary meaning of the word âcommunicateâ is to impart, confer or transmit information. (Cf. Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Vol. 1, p. 352). As already stated, telegrams, dated July 31, and August 2, 1958, were despatched to the respondent at the address given by him where communications by Government should be despatched.
Both the telegrams transmitted or imparted information to the respondent that he was suspended from service with effect from August 2, 1958. It may be that he actually received them in or about the middle of August 1958, after the date of his retirement. But how can it be said that the information about his having been suspended was not imparted or transmitted to him on July 31 and August 2, 1958 i.e. before August 4, 1958, when he would have retired? It will be seen that in all the decisions cited before us it was the communication of the impugned order which was held to be essential 5 (1969) 3 SCC 28  and not its actual receipt by the officer concerned and such communication was held to be necessary because till the order is issued and actually sent out to the person concerned the authority making such order would be in a position to change its mind and modify it if it thought fit. But once such an order is sent out, it goes out of the control of such an authority, and therefore, there would be no chance whatsoever of its changing its mind or modifying it. In our view, once an order is issued and it is sent out to the concerned government servant, it must be held to have been communicated to him, no matter when he actually received it. We find it difficult to persuade ourselves to accept the view that it is only from the date of the actual receipt by him that the order becomes effective. If that be the true meaning of communication, it would be possible for a government servant to effectively thwart an order by avoiding receipt of it by one method or the other till after the date of his retirement even though such an order is passed and despatched to him before such date. An officer against whom action is sought to be taken, thus, may go away from the address given by him for service of such orders or may deliberately give a wrong address and thus prevent or delay its receipt and be able to defeat its service on him. Such a meaning of the word âcommunicationâ ought not to be given unless the provision in question expressly so provides. Actual knowledge by him of an order where it is one of dismissal, may, perhaps, become necessary because of the consequences which the decision in The State of Punjab v. Amar Singh contemplates. But such consequences would not occur in the case of an officer who has proceeded on leave and against whom an order of suspension is passed because in his case there is no question of his doing any act or passing any order and such act or order being challenged as invalid.â (Emphasis supplied)

13. In view of the aforesaid judgment, the assertion that an order of transfer was not received by the employee is not relevant to hold that the termination order was fake. The order was issued, as deposed by the employer witness. Even if, the employee has  managed not to receive the same, the termination order does not become fake or ingenuine. Therefore, the finding of the Industrial Court on question No. 2 was rightly set aside by the High Court. We affirm the order of the High Court but on the ground other than which weighed with it. Thus, we find that the appellant is not entitled to dispute the termination order as not real or bona fide for the reason that it was not received by him.

14. The act of transfer can be unfair labour practice if the transfer is actuated by mala fide. The allegations of mala fide have two facets â one malice in law and the other being malice in fact. The challenge to the transfer is based upon malice in fact as it is an action taken by the employer on account of two officers present in Conference. In a judgment reported as State of Bihar & Anr. v. P.P. Sharma, IAS & Anr.6, this Court held that mala fide means want of good faith, personal bias, grudge, oblique or improper motive or ulterior purpose. The plea of mala fide involves two questions, namely (i) whether there is a personal bias or an oblique motive, and (ii) whether the administrative action is contrary to the objects, requirements and conditions of a valid exercise of administrative power. As far as second aspect is concerned, there is a power of transfer vested in the employer in terms of letter of appointment. Even in terms of the provisions of the Act, the transfer by itself cannot be said to be an act of unfair labour 6 1992 Supp (1) SCC 222 practice unless it is actuated by mala fide. Therefore, to sustain a plea of mala fide, there has to be an element of personal bias or an oblique motive. This Court held as under:

â50. Mala fides means want of good faith, personal bias, grudge, oblique or improper motive or ulterior purpose. The administrative action must be said to be done in good faith, if it is in fact done honestly, whether it is done negligently or not. An act done honestly is deemed to have been done in good faith. An administrative authority must, therefore, act in a bona fide manner and should never act for an improper motive or ulterior purposes or contrary to the requirements of the statute, or the basis of the circumstances contemplated by law, or improperly exercised discretion to achieve some ulterior purpose. The determination of a plea of mala fide involves two questions, namely (i) whether there is a personal bias or an oblique motive, and ( ii) whether the administrative action is contrary to the objects, requirements and conditions of a valid exercise of administrative power.
51. The action taken must, therefore, be proved to have been made mala fide for such considerations. Mere assertion or a vague or bald statement is not sufficient. It must be demonstrated either by admitted or proved facts and circumstances obtainable in a given case. If it is established that the action has been taken mala fide for any such considerations or by fraud on power or colourable exercise of power, it cannot be allowed to stand.
xx xx xx
59. Malice in law could be inferred from doing of wrongful act intentionally without any just cause or excuse or without there being reasonable relation to the purpose of the exercise of statutory power. Malice in law is not established from the omission to consider some documents said to be relevant to the accused. Equally reporting the commission of a crime to the Station House Officer, cannot be held to be a colourable exercise of power with bad faith or fraud on power. It  may be honest and bona fide exercise of power. There are no grounds made out or shown to us that the first information report was not lodged in good faith. State of Haryana v. Ch. Bhajan Lal [1992 Supp (1) SCC 335 : JT 1990 (4) SC 650] is an authority for the proposition that existence of deep seated political vendetta is not a ground to quash the FIR. Therein despite the attempt by the respondent to prove by affidavit evidence corroborated by documents of the mala fides and even on facts as alleged no offence was committed, this Court declined to go into those allegations and relegated the dispute for investigation. Unhesitatingly I hold that the findings of the High Court that FIR gets vitiated by the mala fides of the Administrator and the charge-sheets are the results of the mala fides of the informant or investigator, to say the least, is fantastic and obvious gross error of law.â
15. In another judgment reported as Prabodh Sagar v. Punjab State Electricity Board & Ors.7, it was held by this Court that the mere use of the expression âmala fideâ would not by itself make the petition entertainable. The Court held as under:

â13. â¦ Incidentally, be it noted that the expression âmala fideâ is not meaningless jargon and it has its proper connotation. Malice or mala fides can only be appreciated from the records of the case in the facts of each case. There cannot possibly be any set guidelines in regard to the proof of mala fides. Mala fides, where it is alleged, depends upon its own facts and circumstances. We ourselves feel it expedient to record that the petitioner has become more of a liability than an asset and in the event of there being such a situation vis-Ã -vis an employee, the employer will be within his liberty to take appropriate steps including the cessation of relationship between the employer and the employee. The service conditions of the Board's employees also provide for voluntary (sic compulsory) retirement, a person of the nature of the petitioner, as more fully detailed hereinbefore, cannot possibly be given any redress against the order of the Board for 7 (2000) 5 SCC 630  voluntary retirement. There must be factual support pertaining to the allegations of mala fides, unfortunately there is none. Mere user of the word âmala fideâ by the petitioner would not by itself make the petition entertainable. The Court must scan the factual aspect and come to its own conclusion i.e. exactly what the High Court has done and that is the reason why the narration has been noted in this judgment in extenso. â¦â
16. In a judgment reported as HMT Ltd. & Anr. v. Mudappa & Ors.8, quoting from earlier judgment of this Court reported as State of A.P. & Ors. v. Goverdhanlal Pitti9, it was held that âlegal maliceâ or âmalice in lawâ means âsomething done without lawful excuseâ. It is an act done wrongfully and willfully without reasonable or probable cause, and not necessarily an act done from ill feeling and spite. The Court held as under:

â24. The Court also explained the concept of legal mala fide. By referring to Words and Phrases Legally Defined , 3rd Edn., London Butterworths, 1989 the Court stated:
(Goverdhanlal case [(2003) 4 SCC 739], SCC p. 744, para 12) â12. The legal meaning of malice is âill will or spite towards a party and any indirect or improper motive in taking an actionâ. This is sometimes described as âmalice in factâ. âLegal maliceâ or âmalice in lawâ means âsomething done without lawful excuseâ. In other words, âit is an act done wrongfully and wilfully without reasonable or probable cause, and not necessarily an act done from ill feeling and spite. It is a deliberate act in disregard of the rights of others.â â It was observed that where malice was attributed to the State, it could not be a case of malice in fact, or 8 (2007) 9 SCC 768 9 (2003) 4 SCC 739  personal ill-will or spite on the part of the State. It could only be malice in law i.e. legal mala fide. The State, if it wishes to acquire land, could exercise its power bona fide for statutory purpose and for none other. It was observed that it was only because of the decree passed in favour of the owner that the proceedings for acquisition were necessary and hence, notification was issued. Such an action could not be held mala fide.â

17. In a judgment reported as Union of India & Ors. v. Ashok Kumar & Ors.10, it has been held that allegations of mala fides are often more easily made than proved, and the very seriousness of such allegations demands proof of a high order of credibility. The Court held as under:

â21. Doubtless, he who seeks to invalidate or nullify any act or order must establish the charge of bad faith, an abuse or a misuse by the authority of its powers. While the indirect motive or purpose, or bad faith or personal ill will is not to be held established except on clear proof thereof, it is obviously difficult to establish the state of a man's mind, for that is what the employee has to establish in this case, though this may sometimes be done. The difficulty is not lessened when one has to establish that a person apparently acting on the legitimate exercise of power has, in fact, been acting mala fide in the sense of pursuing an illegitimate aim. It is not the law that mala fides in the sense of improper motive should be established only by direct evidence.
But it must be discernible from the order impugned or must be shown from the established surrounding factors which preceded the order. If bad faith would vitiate the order, the same can, in our opinion, be deduced as a reasonable and inescapable inference from proved facts. (S. Pratap Singh v. State of Punjab [(1964) 4 SCR 733 : AIR 1964 SC 72] .) It cannot be overlooked that the burden of establishing mala fides is very heavy on the person who alleges it. The allegations of mala fides are often more easily made 10 (2005) 8 SCC 760  than proved, and the very seriousness of such allegations demands proof of a high order of credibility. As noted by this Court in E.P. Royappa v. State of T.N. [(1974) 4 SCC 3 : 1974 SCC (L&S) 165 : AIR 1974 SC 555] courts would be slow to draw dubious inferences from incomplete facts placed before them by a party, particularly when the imputations are grave and they are made against the holder of an office which has a high responsibility in the administration. (See Indian Rly. Construction Co. Ltd. v. Ajay Kumar [(2003) 4 SCC 579 : 2003 SCC (L&S) 528] .)â

18. In another judgment reported as Ratnagiri Gas and Power Private Limited v. RDS Projects Limited & Ors.11, this Court held that when allegations of mala fides are made, the persons against whom the same are levelled need to be impleaded as parties to the proceedings to enable them to answer the charge. A judicial pronouncement declaring an action to be mala fide is a serious indictment of the person concerned that can lead to adverse civil consequences against him. The Court held as under:

â27. There is yet another aspect which cannot be ignored. As and when allegations of mala fides are made, the persons against whom the same are levelled need to be impleaded as parties to the proceedings to enable them to answer the charge. In the absence of the person concerned as a party in his/her individual capacity it will neither be fair nor proper to record a finding that malice in fact had vitiated the action taken by the authority concerned. It is important to remember that a judicial pronouncement declaring an action to be mala fide is a serious indictment of the person concerned that can lead to adverse civil consequences against him. Courts have, therefore, to be slow in drawing conclusions when it comes to holding allegations of mala fides to be proved and only in cases 11 (2013) 1 SCC 524  where based on the material placed before the Court or facts that are admitted leading to inevitable inferences supporting the charge of mala fides that the Court should record a finding in the process ensuring that while it does so, it also hears the person who was likely to be affected by such a finding.â
19. The allegation in the complaint is that the transfer was actuated for the reason that the employee had raised voice against removal of Shri Khare from the venue of a Conference. The officers present in the said Conference were the Regional Manager or Sales Manager, whereas order of transfer was passed by Mr. Suresh Srinivasan, General Manager-HR. It is an admitted fact that there is power of transfer with the employer. The allegations are against the persons present in the Conference but there is no allegation against the person who has passed the order of transfer. None of the named persons including the person present in Conference have been impleaded as parties to rebut such allegations. Since the order of transfer is in terms of the letter of appointment, therefore, the mere fact that the employee was transferred will per se not make it mala fide. The allegations of mala fide are easier to levy than to prove.

20. Therefore, the allegation that the transfer of the appellant was an act of unfair labour practice without impleading the person who is said to have acted in a mala fide manner is not sustainable.
21. We do not find that the appellant has laid any foundation to allege a malice in law. As mentioned in the judgments referred to above, malice in law would be something which is done without lawful excuse or an act done wrongfully and willfully without reasonable or probable cause. There is power of transfer in the letter of appointment. The appellant has stayed at Sagar for almost 20 years. If an employee is transferred after 20 years and that to the place of headquarters of a company, it cannot be said that the act of transfer was done without lawful excuse. No inference can be drawn that an act was done from ill feeling or spite.

22. The next question which was vehemently argued by Mr. Cama, learned senior counsel for the employer was that the order of termination can be disputed only before the Labour Court in terms of Section 7 of the Act read with Item 1 of Schedule IV of the Act and not before the Industrial Court. Learned counsel for the appellant argued that the termination was ancillary to the order of transfer or a consequence of not joining the transferred station. Therefore, in terms of Section 32 of the Act, there need not be any separate challenge to the termination as such termination is a consequence of transfer and, thus, will fall within the scope of Section 32 of the Act.

23. We do not find any merit in the arguments raised by the learned counsel for the appellant. The jurisdiction of the Industrial Court is, inter alia, to decide complaints relating to unfair labour practices except unfair labour practices falling under Item 1 of Schedule IV. The unfair labour practices mentioned in Item 1 of Schedule IV fall within the jurisdiction of the Labour Court (See Section 7). In view of the specific provision that the complaint relating to unfair labour practices described in Item 1 of Schedule IV fall within the jurisdiction of the Labour Court, therefore, the Industrial Court will not have jurisdiction to examine the question of termination as a consequence of the order of transfer. Since the statute creates a forum for redressal of grievances in respect of termination of services, it is the said forum alone which can be invoked for redressal of grievances. The jurisdiction of a forum can be invoked only in accordance with the statutory provisions. Therefore, alleging termination as a consequence of non-joining on the transferred post will not confer jurisdiction on the Industrial Court. The dispute regarding termination as act of victimization falls exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Labour Court. Consequently, we do not find that the appellant has made out any case for interference against an order passed by the High Court in the present appeal. Therefore, the Labour Court alone was competent to decide the issue of alleged un-lawful termination of the appellant.

24. In view of the above, we do not find any merit in the present appeal. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.",lb
"HEMANT GUPTA, J.

1) The legality and validity of an order passed by the Chief Commissioner of Land Administration, Andhra Pradesh 1 on February 26, 2003 is subject matter of consideration in the present appeal. Vide aforesaid order, 19.26 standard acres of land in Village Poppalguda, District Ranga Reddy was allotted to the appellant by the CCLA (as a delegatee of the Central Government) as balance of verified claim of 43.7 standard acres of land.

2) Some facts would be necessary to appreciate the contention raised by the parties. One Parsram Ramchand Malani, father of the appellant, was resident of Sindh in the present-day Pakistan and 1 for short, âCCLAâ  after partition, came to settle in Hyderabad. The father of the appellant asserted that he was owner of 83.11 acres of land in Sindh. Such land was verified vide an order passed by Settlement Claim Officer, Bombay on November 22, 1952 (copy submitted by the appellant during the course of the arguments). On the basis of such order, the father of the appellant applied for 200 acres of land in lieu of 83.11 acres of land left by him in the West Pakistan (copy submitted by the appellant during the course of the arguments). It is on the basis of such application that 40.4 standard acres of land (323.10 local acres) was allotted in District Hyderabad East, Village Bata Singaram, measuring 32.12 standard acres (262.11 local acres) and in Hyderabad West, Village Boinapally measuring 7.8 standard acres (60.39 local acres). There is no dispute between the parties till such allotment. Such allotment was made prior to commencement of the Displaced Persons (Compensation & Rehabilitation) Act, 19542. Therefore, to regularise such allotment, another letter was issued on March 24, 1956 after commencement of the Act. The father of the appellant did not raise any claim for allotment of additional land till his death on August 10, 1988. It may be mentioned that Rule 51 of the Displaced Persons (Compensation & Rehabilitation) Rules, 1955 3 provides for scale of compensation in the form of land in accordance with the Land Allotment Scheme in the States of Punjab and Patiala and the East Punjab States Union as set out in Appendix XIV. A perusal of 2 for short, âActâ 3 for short, âRulesâ  Appendix XIV would show that against area abandoned of 83 standard acres, the entitlement is allotment of 45.8Â¾ acres. It has also come on record that the father of the appellant, the displaced person, sold the entire land allotted to him soon after allotment.

3) The appellant addressed a letter to the CCLA on March 15, 2001 claiming allotment of 43.7 standard acres against balance of verified claim. The CCLA addressed the letter to the Settlement Officer, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India on May 5, 2001 but no response was received from the Ministry of Home Affairs. On February 21, 2003, the appellant made another representation to the CCLA pursuant to which CCLA allotted the land measuring 19.26 standard acres (148.3 local acres) in Survey No. 301 to 308, 325 to 328 and 331 part in favour of the appellant on February 26, 2003, which is the subject matter of present appeal.

4) The orders of CCLA were stayed by a memo of Government of Andhra Pradesh dated March 20, 2003. The Secretary to Revenue Department in the Government of Andhra Pradesh initiated suo moto proceedings in respect of six cases of allotment of evacuee property in Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy District. Subsequently, a show-cause notice was issued to the appellant on August 20, 2003. The appellant filed writ petition before High Court of Andhra Pradesh challenging the show-cause notice and the stay order dated March 20, 2003. The High Court disposed of the writ petition  on November 14, 2003 with a direction to the appellant to approach the Revisional Authority. The Revisional Authority dismissed the revision filed by the State on June 28, 2006 holding that the allotment of land is in accordance with the Act.

5) The said order was challenged by the State through the District Collector, Ranga Reddy District by way of a writ petition before the High Court at Hyderabad. Such writ petition was allowed on February 12, 2016. It is the said order which is subject matter of challenge in the present appeal.

6) The High Court has, inter alia, found that CCLA was not the competent authority to make allotment of land, inter alia, for the reason that there was no delegation by the Central Government in his favour to make allotment and secondly, for the reason that the land stood transferred to the State Government on the basis of communication dated May 24, 1980 and was, thus, not available in compensation pool for allotment. Thirdly, the High Court also found that the claim of the appellant suffers from delay and laches.

7) A brief resume of the Act, process of allotment and subsequent repeal of the Act needs to be recapitulated. In the aftermath of partition of the country in 1947, there was large scale movement of population from one part of the country to another country. Since, large scale of population moved, there was a question of the rehabilitation of the population migrating from one country to another to deal with the property of the population who left the  country. The property of the persons who left the country vested in the Union under the Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1950. The custodian was responsible for preservation, management and administration of evacuee property as was done by various State legislatures. However, the law governing allotment of evacuee property to displaced persons was statutorily provided by the Act. The procedure was that the persons who migrated to the country will apply for verification of their property including land left behind in West Pakistan and such property was verified on the basis of revenue record either received by the Government of India or verified by the revenue authorities in Pakistan. Such verification of the property was called as verified claim in terms of Section 2(e) of the Act. Such verified claim entitles the migrant defined as displaced person in Section 2(b) of the Act for compensation in the manner prescribed under Section 8 of the Act. The property left by the persons migrating to Pakistan (evacuee persons) was put in the compensation pool as defined in Section 2(a) of the Act and was a source of resettling the displaced persons.

8) The process of resettling the displaced persons is based upon the following steps as found by this Court in Amar Singh & Ors. v. Custodian, Evacuee Property, Punjab & Anr.4:

â1. Registration and verification of land claims.
2. Assessment and valuation of such claims.
3. Classification of the villages and of lands of evacuees 4 AIR 1957 SC 599  available for allotment.

4. Allocation of the claims to various areas with reference to such classification.

5. Allotment of lands to individuals with reference to the valuation of their claims, guided by various considerations, priorities and preferences and so forth administratively determined.â

9) The first step is registration and verification of land claims i.e. verification of the property such as land in the present day Pakistan. The assessment and valuation of such claims is the second step which is required, for which Rule 51 read with Appendix XIV prescribes the scale of land which can be allotted in view of verified claim of the property left in the present day Pakistan. The third step is identification of evacuee land available which forms part of the compensation pool. Such land including urban and rural land available for allotment with reference to the valuation of the claims guided by other consideration, priorities and preferences.

10) The displaced person as defined in Section 2(b) of the Act includes successor-in-interest of any such person. Such displaced person having a verified claim has to make an application for payment of compensation on or before June 30, 1955. The Settlement Commissioner would make an inquiry in the manner prescribed to determine the amount of compensation. A displaced person is entitled to payment of cash compensation or compensation in terms of land out of compensation pool in terms of Section 8 of the  Act. Section 12 empowers the Central Government to acquire any evacuee property for a public purpose being a purpose connected with the relief and rehabilitation of displaced persons. In terms of sub-section (4) of Section 12, all evacuee property acquired in terms of sub-section (1) or sub-section (3) forms part of the compensation pool. Section 16 of the Act empowers the Central Government to take such measures as it considers necessary or expedient for the custody, management and disposal of the compensation pool. Section 16(2)(b) empowers the Central Government to constitute such authority or corporation as it may deem fit for the management and disposal of the compensation pool.

11) The Managing Officer or the Managing Corporation is competent to transfer any property out of compensation pool in terms of Section 20 of the Act but the allotment is as per the valuation determined by the Settlement Commissioner in terms of Section 20(1)(c) of the Act. The relevant provisions of the statute read as under:

âTHE DISPLACED PERSONS (COMPENSATION & REHABILITATION) ACT, 1954 2(a) ""compensation pool"" means the compensation pool constituted under section 14;
2(b) ""displaced person"" means any person who, on account of the setting up of the Dominions of India and Pakistan, or on account of civil disturbances or the fear of such disturbances in any area now forming part of West Pakistan, has after the first day of March, 1947, left, or been displaced from, his place of residence in such area and who has been subsequently residing in India, and includes any person who is resident in any place now forming part of India and who for that reason is unable or has been rendered unable to manage, supervise or control any immovable property belonging to him in West Pakistan, and also includes the successors- in interest of any such person;

xx xx xx

4. Application for payment of compensation. â (1) The Central Government shall, from time to time, but not later than the thirtieth day of June, 1955, by notification in the Official Gazette, require all displaced persons having a verified claim to make applications for the payment of compensation and any such notification may be issued with reference to displaced persons residing in any State or in any one of a group of States.

xx xx xx

8. Form and manner of payment of compensation. â (1) A displaced person shall be paid out of the compensation pool the amount of net compensation determined under sub- section (3) of section 7 as being payable to him, and subject to any rules that may be made under this Act, the Settlement Commissioner or any other officer or authority authorised by the Chief Settlement Commissioner in this behalf may make such payment in any one of the following forms or partly in one and partly in any other form, namely:-

(a) in cash;

(b) in Government bonds;

(c) by sale to the displaced person of any property from the compensation pool and setting off the purchase money against the compensation payable to him;

(d) by any other mode of transfer to the displaced person of any property from the compensation pool and setting off the valuation of the property against the compensation payable to him;

(e) by transfer of shares or debentures in any company or corporation;

(f) in such other form as may be prescribed. (2) For the purpose of payment of compensation under this Act, the Central Government may, by rules, provide for all or any of the following matters, namely:-

(a) the classes of displaced persons to whom compensation may be paid;

(b) the scales according to which, the form and manner in which, and the instalment by which, compensation may be paid to different classes of displaced persons;

(c) the valuation of all property, shares and debentures to be transferred to displaced persons;

(d) any other matter which is to be, or may be, prescribed.

xx xx xx

14. Compensation pool. â (1) For the purpose of payment of compensation and rehabilitation grants to displaced persons, there shall be constituted a compensation pool which shall consist ofâ

(a) all evacuee property acquired under section 12, including the sale proceeds of any such property and all profits and income accruing from such property;

(b) such cash balances lying with the Custodian as may, by order of the Central Government, be transferred to the compensation pool;

(c) such contributions, in any form whatsoever, as may be made to the compensation pool by the Central Government or any State Government;

(d) such other assets as may be prescribed. (2) The compensation pool shall vest in the Central Government free from all encumbrances and shall be utilised in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder.

xx xx xx

16. Management of compensation pool. â (1) The Central Government may take such measures as it considers necessary or expedient for the custody, management and disposal of the compensation pool in order that it may be effectively utilised in accordance with the provisions of this Act.

(2) In particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power, the Central Government may, for the purposes referred to in sub-section (1), by notification in the Official Gazette.-

(a) appoint such officers as it may deem fit (hereinafter referred to as managing officers); or

(b) constitute such authority or corporation, as it may deem fit (hereinafter referred to as managing corporation).

(3) Every managing corporation shall be constituted under such name and shall consist of such number of persons as may be specified in the notification, and every such corporation shall be a body corporate having perpetual succession and a common seal and shall by the said name sue and be sued:

Provided that one-third of the members of every managing corporation shall be non-officials.",lb

1. The width and amplitude of the expression âcommercial siteâ in Section 2 (5) and Section 81 (1) (q) of the Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963 (for short, â the Actâ), falls for our consideration in these Appeals. Commercial sites are exempted from the purview of the Act. The question whether a rocky land which is used for quarrying purposes can be treated as a âcommercial siteâ and thereby excluded from the applicability of the Act was answered by a learned Single Judge of the Kerala High Court by holding that mere blasting of rocks and conversion into metals does not render the area a âcommercial siteâ.1 Twenty years after the said judgment, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court took a different view. Quarrying was held to be a commercial operation involving the process of manufacture. Hence, it was held that a quarry falls within the ambit of âcommercial siteâ and is exempted from the applicability of the Act.2

2. The Appellant requested environmental clearance for his quarry which was recommended in his favour by the District Expert Appraisal Committee (DEAC) on 25.04.2017. Respondents No.1 and 2 filed a Writ Petition aggrieved by the said recommendation to permit quarry on land which was a plantation site. It is relevant to note that the Appellantâs land was exempted from the realm of the Act as it was a plantation. The objection of Respondent No.1 and 2 was that the Appellant cannot be permitted to use the land for a purpose other than plantation, especially for quarrying operations. After examining the judgments of the High Court in K. Krishnankutty v. State of Kerala and Others (supra) and State of Kerala v. Mohammedali Haji (supra), a learned Single Judge of the High Court of Kerala doubted the correctness of the latter K. Krishnankutty v. State of Kerala and Others. CRP No.1245/1975 State of Kerala v. Mohammedali Haji. (1996) 1 KLT 584 (DB) judgment in State of Kerala v. Mohammedali Haji (supra) and referred the matter to a larger Bench.

3. The Writ Petition filed by Respondent No.1 and 2 was heard by a Full Bench of the Kerala High Court comprising three Judges. The majority opinion was in favour of Respondent No.1 and 2. It was held by the majority that the land which is used for quarrying is not covered by the expression âcommercial siteâ. Therefore, there can be no exemption of such land from the applicability of the Act. The Appellant is aggrieved by the said judgment of the Full Bench of the High Court.

4. Mr. K. V. Vishwanathan, learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant took us through the provisions of the Act including Sections 2(5), 81 and 83 to argue that a quarry is a commercial site, which is exempted under Section 81 (1)

(q) of the Act. He alluded to the statement of objects and reasons to submit that the legislation was made to protect the interests of all stake-holders. He referred to the meaning of the words âcommercial activitiesâ and âbusinessâ to submit that the activity of quarrying is done for profit. Hence, quarrying is a commercial activity. According to him, there can be no distinction between activities done above and below the surface of land for the purpose of deciding whether land is a commercial site or not. He criticized the plurality opinion for erroneously invoking the mischief rule. He commended the judgment of the dissenting Judge for our acceptance. He emphasized that environmental issues are not germane for interpretation of Sections 2 (5) and 81 (1) (q) of the Act.

5. Mr. Pallav Shishodia, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the State of Kerala resisted the submissions made on behalf of the Appellant by submitting that the expression âcommercial siteâ is a term of art and has to be interpreted on the basis of the context in which it is used.

6. Mr. Romy Chacko, learned counsel for the Respondent No.1 and 2 asserted that the Act is a beneficial legislation. When there is a doubt about the meaning of expressions used in such a statute, literal interpretation should be avoided and Courts should adopt the principles of purposive construction. He submitted that the exemption provision should be narrowly construed.

7. Before we consider the submissions made by the learned counsel, it is necessary to examine the provisions of the Act. Section 83 of the Act provides that no person shall be entitled to own or hold or possess under a mortgage, lands in the aggregate in excess of the ceiling area with effect from the date notified by the Government of Kerala in the Gazette. The ceiling area of land is specified in Section 82 of the Act. Lands exempted under Section 81 shall be excluded from computation of the ceiling area as per Section 82 (6) of the Act. Section 81 of the Act is as follows:

81. Exemptions: - (1) the provisions of this Chapter shall not apply to-

a) Lands owned or held by the Government of Kerala or the Government of any other State in India or the Government of India or a local authority [or the Cochin Port Trust] or any other authority which the Government may, in public interest, exempt, by notification in the Gazette, from the provisions of this Chapter.

[Provided that the exemption under this clause shall not apply to lands owned by the Government of Kerala and held by any person under lease whether current or time expired or otherwise.] Explanation I. â âLands owned by the Government of Keralaâ shall, for the purposes of this clause, have the same meaning as âGovernment landsâ under sub- section (1) of Section 2 of the Kerala Government land Assignment Act, 1960 [but lands escheated to the Government and held by tenants entitled to fixity of tenure under Section 13 shall not be deemed to be lands owned by the Government of Kerala;] Explanation II â Lands, the right, title and interest in respect of which have vested in the Government under sub-section (9) of Section 66 or Section 72,  shall not be deemed to be âlands owned by the Government of Keralaâ for the purposes of this clause;] Explanation III - For the purposes of this clause, âother authorityâ shall include a corporation owned or controlled by the Government of Kerala or the Government of any other State in India or the Government of India;]

b) Lands taken under the management of the Court of Wards;

Provided that the exemption under this clause shall cease to apply at the end of three years from the commencement of this Act;

c) Lands comprised of mills, factories or workshops and which are necessary for the use of such mills, factories or workshops;

d) Private forests;

e) Plantations;

f) x x x x

g) x x x x

Provided that the land referred to in clause (b) shall be used for the purpose for which it is intended within such time as the Government may specify in that behalf; and, where the land is not so used within the time specified, the exemption shall cease to be in force.]
8. In the present case, the Appellant is claiming exemption on the ground that a quarry would fall within the sweep of âcommercial siteâ as stated in Section 81 (1)

(q). Commercial site is defined in Section 2 (5) as follows:

ââ2(5) âcommercial siteâ means any land (not being a kudiyiruppu or a kudikidappu or karaima) which is used principally for the purposes of any trade, commerce, industry, manufacture or business;ââ
9. The Appellant contended that the definition of âcommercial siteâ is very wide and any land which is principally used for the purpose of trade, commerce, industry, manufacture or business is a commercial site. According to the Appellant, breaking of rock is a manufacturing activity. Quarrying operations involve digging land and breaking of rocks into metal pieces. It was submitted that digging of land and breaking of rock is for a commercial activity and the sale of stones is for the purpose of trade and business. We are afraid that we cannot agree.",lb

1. The facts revealed during the hearing of these writ petitions filed Signature Not Verified Digitally signed by SANJAY KUMAR Date: 2017.08.02 under Article 32 of the Constitution suggest a mining scandal of enormous 10:54:24 IST Reason:

proportions and one involving megabucks. Lessees in the districts of W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.  Keonjhar, Sundergarh and Mayurbhanj in Odisha have rapaciously mined iron ore and manganese ore, apparently destroyed the environment and forests and perhaps caused untold misery to the tribals in the area. However, to be fair to the lessees, they did the detail steps taken to ameliorate the hardships of the tribals, but it appears to us that their contribution is perhaps not more than a drop in the ocean â also too little, too late. Facts leading up to the report of the Central Empowered Committee

2. Rabi Das, the editor of a daily newspaper called Ama Rajdhani filed I.A. No. 2746-2748 of 2009 in a pending writ petition being T.N. Godavarman v. Union of India.1 He prayed, inter alia, for the following directions from this Court:

â a) Issue a direction to the Central Empowered Committee to conduct an exhaustive fact finding study of the illegal mining in Keonjhar, Sundargarh and other Districts of Orissa;
b) Direct appointment of a âCommissionâ to investigate and study the modalities of the illegal machinations, fix responsibility on individuals (in Government and outside it) and recommend remedial measures to be immediately implemented by the Government of India and the Government of Orissa;
c) Direct the Respondents to take effective and appropriate action to ensure closure/stoppage of all the illegal mining activities in the concerned areas and direct prosecution and punish all those found guilty of this illegal mining in violation of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.  Act, 1957, Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and other relevant laws.â

3. The applications were taken up for consideration on 6 th November, 2009 when notice was issued to the Central Empowered Committee (for short âthe CECâ) to file its report/response within six weeks.

4. On 26th April, 2010 the CEC submitted an interim report which was noted by this Court and taken on record. The report was of a general nature but contained quite a few recommendations. Some of the recommendations presently relevant are as follows:

â(b) Even otherwise the Rule 24-A(6), MCR, 1960 does not authorize the lessee to operate a mine without the statutory clearances/approvals. Therefore, in respect of a mine covered under the âdeemed extensionâ clause, the mining operations should be permitted to be undertaken in the non forest area of the mining lease only if (i) it has the requisite environmental clearance; (ii) it has the consent to operate from the State Pollution Control Board under the Air and Water Acts; (iii) Mining Plan is duly approved by the competent authority; and (iv) the NPV for the entire forest falling within the mining lease is deposited in the Compensatory Afforestation Fund.
The mining in the forest land included in the mining lease should be permissible only if, in addition to the above, the approval under the FC Act/TWP has been obtained;
(c) No forest land can be leased/assigned without first obtaining the approval under the FC Act. Therefore, the forest area approved under the FC Act should not be lesser than the total forest area included in the mining leases approved under the MMDR Act, 1957. Both necessarily have to be the same. In view of the above, this Honâble Court while permitting grant of Temporary Working Permission to the mines in Orissa and Goa has made it one of the pre-conditions that the NPV will be paid for the entire forest area included in the mining W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.  leases. Similarly, all the mining lease holders in Orissa should be directed to pay the NPV for the entire forest area, included in the mining lease;

(d) In Orissa, substantial areas included in the mining leases as non forest land have subsequently been identified as DLC forest (deemed forest/forest like areas) by the Expert Committee constituted by the State Government pursuant to this Honâble Courtâs order dated 12.12.1996. While processing and/or approving the proposals under the FC Act in many cases such areas have been treated as non-forest land. It is recommended that (i) the NPV for the entire DLC area included in the mining lease, after deducting the NPV already paid, should be deposited by the concerned lease holder and

(ii) the mining operations in the unbroken DLC land (virgin land) should be permissible only if the permission under the FC Act has been obtained/is obtained for such area. Keeping in view the peculiar circumstances as was existing in Orissa and subject to the above, the mining operations in the broken DLC land may be allowed to be continued provided the other statutory requirements and Rules are otherwise being complied with.â The report concluded by recording as follows:

â a) an attempt has been made for the first time by the CEC to comply and analyse the status of all the mining leases in a State and to suggest effective and remedial measures -
something made possible because of the unstinted cooperation extended by the senior functionaries of the Forest and Mines Departments of the State Government; and

b) the above recommendations if accepted and implemented will, besides ensuring that mining is done in compliance with the statutory provisions, result in recovery of additional amount towards the NPV etc. running into hundreds of crores of rupees. It would be appropriate that a part of this additional amount, say 50% is used through a SPV for undertaking specific tribal welfare and area development works so as to ensure inclusive growth of the mineral bearing areas. The CEC proposes to file detailed schemes in this regard for seeking permission of this Honâble Court provided the State W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.  of Orissa as well as the MoEF endorse the course of action proposed above.â The significance of the second conclusion will be discussed by us a little later.

5. Notice was issued on the report returnable on 7th May, 2010. On the adjourned date, the following order was passed by this Court:

âThe CEC has filed its Report. The State would like to file its response. Six weeks time is granted for the same. The recommendations of the CEC which are acceptable to the State Government can be complied with.â It may be mentioned that some of the recommendations made by the CEC have been accepted and implemented by the State of Odisha.
6. The issue of mining in Odisha again came up for consideration on 16 th September, 2013 and this Court passed the following order:

âWe call for a report from the Central Empowered Committee within a period of six weeks. We direct that the parties of the State Government of Odisha and the Central Government will cooperate with the Central Empowered Committee to enquire into the matter and furnish a report.
The matter be listed on a Monday after six weeks.â
7. With reference to the order passed on 16th September, 2013 the CEC conducted an inquiry and some information was sought from M/s Sarda Mines Private Limited (for short âSMPLâ). This was objected to by SMPL W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.  who filed an application which was taken up for consideration on 9 th December, 2013. The following order was passed on that day:

âBy our order dated 16th September, 2013, we had called for a Report from the Central Empowered Committee within a period of six weeks. It is stated on behalf of the Central Empowered Committee that the Report could not be ready as part of the information called for have not been furnished by the State Government.
Mr. Venugopal, learned senior counsel for the applicant M/s. Sarda Mines Private Limited in IA No.3721 submits that since some of the matters are pending before the High Court, a prayer has been made for not furnishing the required information to the Central Empowered Committee.
List this matter in the second week of January, 2014.
In the meantime, the Central Empowered Committee may not submit its final Report.â
8. The matter was again taken up on 13 th January, 2014 and this Court passed the following order:

âWe have heard learned counsel for the parties.
We have also perused the letter dated 17 th October, 2013 of the Member Secretary, Central Empowered Committee sent to the Chief Secretary, Government of Odisha along with its annexures and in particular, the Statement of Details of information and documents sought by Central Empowered Committee for the meeting convened on 30th October, 2013, which cover forest and environmental issues.
We, accordingly, modify the order dated 9th December, 2013 and direct the Central Empowered Committee to submit its final report on the queries made by the State Government with regard to the details of the documents sought for in the letter dated 17 th October, 2013 within a period of six weeks.
W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.  The Report will not cover cases other than forest and environmental issues.

The lessees and others from whom information is sought for will cooperate if they do not cooperate the Central Empowered Committee will give its report.

A copy of the interim report of 26th April, 2010 will be furnished to the learned counsel appearing for the State of Odisha. This matter be listed on 20th January, 2014 for consideration of the recommendations made by the Central Empowered Committee in the said Report dated 26th April, 2010.â Thereafter and partly based on reports given by Justice M.B. Shah, a retired judge of this Court, holding a commission under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 a writ petition being W.P. (C) No. 114 of 2014 was filed by Common Cause. Several prayers were made in the writ petition, and some of the more significant prayers read as follows:-

â(a) Issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ directing the Union of India and Government of Odisha to immediately stop forthwith all illegal mining in the State of Odisha and to terminate all leases that are found to be involved in illegal mining and mining in violation of the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act 1980, the environment laws and other laws.
(b) Issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ directing the Union of India and Government of Odisha to take action against all the violators involved either directly or indirectly in illegal mining including those named in the report of Justice Shah Commission.
(c) Issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ directing a thorough investigation by an SIT or CBI under the supervision of this Honâble Court, as is recommended by the Justice W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.  Shah Commission into illegal mining in Odisha and collusion between private companies/individuals and public officials of the State/Central Governments.

                   xxx             xxx            xxx

                   (e)      Issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ
directing the respondents to recover the illegally accumulated wealth through illegal mining and related activity, as per Section 21(5) of the MMDR Act, 1957 [Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957] and launch prosecutions under Section 21(1) of the MMDR Act 1957, and direct that the money recovered would be used for the welfare of local communities, tribals and villagers.â

9. The writ petition was taken up for consideration on 21 st April, 2014 when the following order was passed:

âWe have heard the preliminary objections with regard to the writ petition and we are not convinced that the writ petition is not maintainable.
Issue notice.
As the State of Odisha, Union of India and the CEC have already been served with the notices, no further notices be issued to them.
Notice, however, be issued to respondent nos. 4 and 5 returnable within four weeks.
It appears from the averments in paragraph 14 of the writ petition that several lessees are operating without clearances under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and without renewal by the Government. Hence, an interim order needs to be passed in respect of these lessees who are operating the leases in violation of the law.
For consideration of the interim order that should be passed, only this writ petition be listed next Monday, the 28th of April, 2014, as first item. It will be open for all parties and intervenors/proposed intervenors to file their respective affidavits.
W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.  CEC, in the meanwhile, will make out a list of such lessees who are operating the leases in violation of the law. This list be prepared by the CEC without reference to the Shah Commissionâs Report. Liberty is given to the parties to produce their papers before CEC. The State of Odisha and the Union of India will cooperate with CEC to prepare the list.â Report of the Central Empowered Committee

10. The CEC gave its final report on 25 th April, 2014 which was considered by this Court and a detailed interim order was passed on 16 th May, 2014.2 The sum and substance of the final report dated 25th April, 2014 and the interim order is that in the districts of Odisha that we are concerned with, namely, Keonjhar, Sundergarh and Mayurbhanj, the total number of leases granted for mining iron and manganese ore are 187. Of these, 102 lease holders did not have requisite environmental clearance (under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986) or approval under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 or approved mining plan and/or Consent to Operate under the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 or the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. This Court directed that mining operations in these 102 mining leases shall remain suspended but it will be open to such lease holders to move the concerned authorities for necessary clearances, approvals or consents and âas and when the mining lessees are able to obtain all the 2 Common Cause v. Union of India & Ors. (2014) 14 SCC 155 W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.  clearances/approvals/consent they may move this Court for modification of this interim order in relation to their cases.â

11. This Court also found that 29 out of 187 mining leases had been determined or rejected or had lapsed. It was directed that mining operations in these 29 mining leases will also remain suspended but it would be open to all these concerned lessees to move the authorities for necessary relief and as and when they get the appropriate relief, they could move this Court for modification of the interim order.

12. This Court also found that 53 iron ore/manganese ore mining leases were operational and that they had necessary approvals under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, consent to operate granted by the Odisha State Pollution Control Board and also approved mining plans. (There is no specific mention about environmental clearance). In addition 3 mining leases were located in forest as well as non-forest land, but mining operations were being conducted in non-forest areas of the mining lease as the lease holders did not have approvals under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. Therefore a total of 56 iron ore/manganese ore mining leases were operating in the State of Odisha.

13. As far as the break-up of the 56 operational mining leases is concerned, it was found that 14 mining leases were operating on first renewal basis in W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.  accordance with the deeming provisions of Section 8(2) of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (for short âthe MMDR Actâ) read with Rule 24-A(6) of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 (for short âthe MCRâ) and 16 mining leases were operating since lease deeds for grant of renewal had been executed in their favour. The remaining 26 mining leases were operating on second and subsequent renewal basis with the renewal applications pending a final decision with the State Government.

14. In respect of the 14 first renewal mining leases, this Court permitted them to continue their operations for the time being in view of the deemed renewal provisions. This Court also permitted 16 mining leases to continue to operate since they had lease deeds executed in their favour. With regard to the remaining 26 mining leases operating on second and subsequent renewal applications, this Court drew attention to the decision rendered on 21 st April, 2014 in Goa Foundation v. Union of India3 wherein it was held that the provision for a second or subsequent deemed renewal was not available in view of Section 8(3) of the MMDR Act. Consequently, these 26 lease holders were restrained from operating until express orders were passed by the State Government under Section 8(3) of the MMDR Act. Six months time was granted to the State Government to take a final decision on the 3 (2014) 6 SCC 590 W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.  renewal applications. This Court left it open to the mining lease holders to apply for modification of the interim order dated 16 th May, 2014 on obtaining necessary clearances.

15. During the hearing of these petitions, we were informed that the balance 26 mining leases are now operational in view of the amendment to Section 8(3) of the MMDR Act with effect from 12 th January, 2015. However, we are not aware whether these 26 mining leases have the necessary statutory clearances.

16. We may also mention that pursuant to the liberty granted to move for modification of the interim order of 16 th May, 2014 we have received 17 interim applications for modification. Through a chart handed over to us in Court on 3rd May, 2017 we have been informed that in respect of two of the 17 applications, that is, Zenith Mining (I.A. No. 45) and Kavita Agrawal (I.A. No. 47), the lease has not been extended or has been determined and they do not have any Environmental Clearance or Forest Clearance. In respect of J.N. Pattnaik (I.A. No. 66), there is no Forest Clearance available. We were also informed that S.A. Karim (I.A. No.9) actually had a working lease and had wrongly been included as a non-operational lease. W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
 17. Be that as it may, learned counsel for the lease holders drew our attention to the record of proceedings of 16th May, 2014 and particularly the following paragraph appearing therein:

âWe have passed interim order in a separate sheet. The Central Empowered Committee will give a final report on the Writ Petition by the end of July, 2014 and the matter will be listed in the first week of August, 2014 before the Green Bench.â We are mentioning this in the context of the order passed on 13 th January, 2014 adverted to above to the effect that âThe Report will not cover cases other than forest and environmental issues.â
18. In its final report, the CEC has dealt with the following ten topics: In this final report dated the CEC dealt with the following ten topics:-

âI. Production of iron ore and manganese ore without/in excess of the environmental clearance/Mining Plan/Consent to Operate.
II. Mining leases operated in violation of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.
III. Illegal mining outside the sanctioned mining lease areas.
IV. Mining leases acquired in violation of Section 6 of the MMDR Act, 1957.
V. Violation of Rule 37 of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 by the lessees.
VI. Illegalities involved in the mining leases of Essel Mining & Industries Ltd.
W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.  VII. Illegalities involved in the mining lease of Sharda Mines (P) Ltd.

VIII. Massive illegal mining in Uliburu Forest land. IX. Inordinate delays in taking decisions by the State Government regarding renewal of the mining leases.

X. Other issues.â

19. By an order dated 16th January, 2015 objections to the final report were permitted and we have since received quite a few objections. When the matter was taken up for consideration by this Court on 7th October, 2015 and pursuant to the order passed on that date, the learned Amicus filed a statement dated 30th October, 2015 in a tabular form dealing with each I.A. filed in respect of the observations and recommendations made by CEC. Thereafter, when the matter was again taken up for consideration the learned Amicus filed a note dated 15th March, 2016 wherein the following four issues were flagged:-

â(i) Leases lapsed under Section 4A(4) of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (hereinafter referred to as MMDR Act, 1957) (11 leases);
(ii) Violation of Rule 24 of the Minerals (other than Atomic and Hydrocarbons Energy Minerals) Concession Rules, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as MCR, 2016) and Rule 37 of the Mineral Concessions Rules, 1960 (hereinafter referred to as MCR, 1960) (9 leases);
(iii) Illegal mining in forest lands (20 leases); and W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
 (iv) Iron ore produced without/in excess of the environmental clearance (each of the operating leases involved).â

20. Insofar as the first issue is concerned, it is common ground that that issue has been fully, conclusively and exhaustively dealt with by this Court by a judgment and order dated 4 th April, 2016 (Common Cause v. Union of India).4 Therefore, the first issue does not survive for consideration by us.

21. As far as the remaining three issues are concerned, these overlap with topics I, II and V dealt with by the CEC. Detailed submissions were made before us by learned counsel for all the appearing parties on these issues as well as by the learned Amicus and the learned Attorney General. We propose to deal with them in this judgment and order.

22. We may mention that submissions were also made on topics III and IV identified by the CEC, that is, illegal mining outside the sanctioned mining lease areas and mining leases acquired in violation of Section 6 of the MMDR Act. We will consider these issues as well.

23. As far as topics VI and VII identified by the CEC are concerned, we would like to hear the parties in detail in respect of these issues.

24. No challenges or submissions were made on topics VIII, IX and X and therefore we accept the report of the CEC on these topics. 4 (2016) 11 SCC 455 W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
 25. At this stage, we may mention some rather frightening figures mentioned by the CEC in its final report. According to the CEC, excess mining without environmental clearance or beyond what was authorized by the environmental clearance is 2130.988 lakh MT of iron ore and 24.129 lakh MT of manganese ore making a total of 2155.117 lakh MT of iron and manganese ore. This does not include extraction of ore without forest clearance. These figures give an indication of the extent of excess or illegal or unlawful mining carried out.",lb
"Advocate for the Petitioner   : MS.M KHANIKAR

Advocate for the Respondent : GA, ASSAM
BEFORE HONOURABLE MR JUSTICE SONGKHUPCHUNG SERTO JUDGMENT & ORDER (CAV) Date : 27-02-2020 This is a civil revision petition filed under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 read with Article 227 of the Constitution of India, directed against the order dated 08.06.2016, passed by the learned Civil Judge, Hailakandi in Misc Case No. 38/2013 which is connected with Title Execution Case No. 31/2013 arising out of Title Suit No. 26/2010 of the Court of Civil Judge, Hailakandi.

2. Heard Mr. N. Dhar, learned counsel for the petitioner and also heard Mr. S. Biswas, learned Standing counsel who appears for all the respondents.

3. The facts and circumstances which led to the filing of this civil revision petition briefly stated are as follows;

On 22.07.2010, while the petitioner was transporting 152 pieces of teak wood on a hired truck bearing Registration No. AS-24/0764 to Silchar from his village Mauja Shyampur under Katlicherra Revenue Circle, the respondent No.3 detained the truck and seized the Page No.# 3/21 timber. Thereafter, on 15.09.2010, the petitioner served a notice to the respondents but since no positive action was taken for releasing the truck and his timber he filed a Title Suit No. 26/2010 before the Court of Civil Judge, Hailakandi on 23.11.2010 wherein he prayed for a decree directing the respondents to pay him damage for pecuniary and non pecuniary loss suffered by him due to the detention of the hired truck and his seized timbers. The suit was contested by the respondents. On 18.03.2013, the suit was disposed with a decree passed in his favour in which it was declared that he was entitled to get a sum of Rs. 22,27,000/- from the defendants for the loss suffered by him due to the seizure and detention of the hired truck and his timber. It was also decreed that the defendants/respondents should pay the said amount to the plaintiff within 2(two) months from the date of passing of the judgment and decree. Since the judgment and decree were not honoured by the respondents, the petitioner filed Title Execution Case No. 31/2013. While, the execution case was pending, the respondents filed a Misc Application No. 30(A)/2013 praying for dismissal of the execution proceeding and at the same time praying for stay of the execution proceeding till the disposal of the misc application. The main contention of the petitioner in the misc application (respondents herein) was that under section-49(4) of Assam Forest Regulation (Amendment) Act, 1995, the District Forest Officer is the authority to deal with any issue in respect of the seized forest produce and if any of the parties is not satisfied with the decision of the District Forest Officer they can approach the District Judge under section 49(C) of the same Act. As such, the judgment and decree of the learned Civil Judge were passed without jurisdiction and it cannot be executed. After hearing the parties, the learned Civil Judge passed the impugned order wherein he came to the conclusion that the learned Civil Judge who tried the Title Suit had no jurisdiction to try the same, therefore, the judgment and decree passed in Page No.# 4/21 the suit are not enforceable. Being aggrieved by this order, the petitioner is before this Court. The relevant portions of the impugned order are reproduced here below;

""3. After hearing both sides at length, it transpires that the subject matter is the Forest Produce and squarely falls within the Assam Forest Regulation, 1891. There is no pale of controversy that on 22/07/2010 he loaded 152 pieces of teak logs in vehicle No. AS/0764 for selling at Silchar though they had TP of only 50 pieces of log issued by the authority. On the way to Silchar, Range Officer, Matijuri and his staff detained the vehicle with logs along with TP dated 22/07/2010. In respect of detained forest produce, an offence report was submitted vide offence report No. M/12 dated 11/04/2010 which was accepted by the Divisional Forest Officer, Hailankandi and summoned the plaintiff to appear before him on 08/09/2010 for disposal of the said matter. The decree holder appeared but no appropriate step was taken. The owner of seized vehicle with forest produce instituted CR Case No. 1023/2010 before the learned C.J.M, Hailakandi against the plaintiff and prayed for issuance of search warrant u/s-94 of Cr.P.C for recovery of the vehicle but the learned C.J.M, Hailakandi rejected the prayer as the vehicle was seized u/s-49 of Assam Forest Regulation (Amended Act) 1995 which outset jurisdiction of Criminal Court in respect of seizure, detention etc. of forest produce. However, O.P/D.H has contended that the truck loaded with logs kept detained without following the procedure as per ""Assam (Control of Felling and removal of trees from non-forest lands) Rules, 2002. The DFO, Hailakandi/petitioner accepted offence report No. M/12 dated 11/06/2010 and summoned the O.P/D.H quite illegally to appear before him on 08/09/2010 for disposal of the said matter. The O.P/D.H appeared accordingly, the DFO, Hailakandi fully confirmed about the seized properties, but till date no appropriate actions were taken from their side to handover the seized properties to the O.P/D.H. For the negligence and deficiency of service of the JD/petitioner caused pecuniary and no pecuniary damages to the O.P/D.H for which he instituted the Title Suit No. 26/2010 claiming damages.
4. Now the crux point to be determined- whether the court of Civil Judge was the competent court having jurisdiction to decide the T.S No. 26/2010 which was virtually arose of confiscating proceeding.
It's pertinent to state that the power conferred to the Executing Court under section 47 C.P.C is very limited. It's only applicable to question relates to execution, discharge or satisfaction of the decree and it must arise between the parties to the suit in which decree was passed or their representatives. Further, it's a settled proposition of law that Executing Page No.# 5/21 Court cannot go behind the decree unless it is shown that it is passed by a court having inherent lack of jurisdiction, which would make it a nullity. (Relied on Bhawarlal Bhandari -versus- Universal Heavy Mechanical Lifting Enterprises, (1999) 1 SCC 558). In the present case, it's evident that the Decree Holder did not take the recourse of special enactment/law i.e. The Assam Forest Regulation, 1891. He has directly filed the T.S No. 26/2010 in the Court of Civil Judge and after trial obtained a judgment and decree dated 18-03-2013. As per Section-49-B, any person aggrieved of the order passed by the Forest Officer not below the rank of Forest Range Officer, shall prefer a review petition before a Conservator of Forest. Further, against the said order, Appeal may be preferred in the Court of District Judge within 30 days as per section 49-C of the Assam Forest Regulation, 1891. Rather than doing that the O.P/D.H directly instituted T.S No. 26/2010 in the Court of Civil Judge and got the decree in his favour. Thus, in view of the provision under section-49-A, 49-B and 49-C of the Assam Forest Regulation, 1891, I find, the learned court Civil Judge has lack of inherent jurisdiction to try the suit. Consequently, the execution of decree in T. Ex. Case No. 31/13 passed in T.S No. 26/2010 is not enforceable being nullity. Accordingly, the instant Misc. Case stands disposed of.""
4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the Executing Court which passed the impugned order has erred in having held that the trial court did not have jurisdiction because it is not for the Executing Court to go behind the judgment but to execute the same as it were. The learned counsel in support of his submission relied on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court passed in the case of Bhawarlal Bhandari -versus- Universal Heavy Mechanical Lifting Enterprises, reported in (1999) 1 SCC 558. The relevant portions of the judgment of paragraph-9 are reproduced here below;

""9. The award dated 17.4.1985 was filed in the court on 23.3.1989 by the arbitrator and the court proceeded to deal with the question whether the award should be made rule of the court or not. Notice was issued by the court to the respondent to show cause as to why this award should not be made rule of the court. There is no dispute that this notice was served on the respondent. Despite such service of notice, for reasons best known to the respondent, it did not think it fit to contest the proceedings nor did it file any objection under Section 30 of the Arbitration Act, 1940. In the result, the court passed an award decree on 2.6.1989 on account of absence of Page No.# 6/21 any contest by the judgment debtor. It is true that this award decree was sought to be executed years thereafter. But the said delay on the part of the decree-holder in executing the decree within the permissible period for limitation in execution of such decree cannot give any sustainable right to the judgment-debtor to challenge the execution proceedings on that ground. The contention of Shri Javali, learned senior counsel for the respondent that the award was a mock one and was not intended to be enforced cannot be sustained as that stage has gone for the respondent. In execution proceedings such a contention requiring the executing court to go behind the decree cannot be sustained. The question whether the award decree was filed by the arbitrator on his own or not was a mixed question of law and fact. The Division Bench in the impugned judgment itself has noted that if the award was filed by the arbitrator suo motu the award decree cannot be said to be barred by limitation but if, on the other hand, the award was filed by the arbitrator at the instance of the appellant- decree-
holder then the question of limitation would arise. The aforesaid observation of the Division bench itself indicates that this is a mixed question of law and fact. That was an issue to be raised before the award was made a rule of Court. But such a plea can never make the decree a nullity especially when the respondent for reasons best known to it did not think it fit to file objections under Section 30 of the Arbitration Act, 1940. It is well settled that the executing court cannot go behind the decree unless it is shown that it is passed by a court having inherent lack of jurisdiction, which would make it a nullity. In the case of Ittavira Mathai v. Varkey Varkey and anr. reported in (1964) 1 SCR 495, a Bench of four learned Judges of this Court speaking through Mudholkar, J. observed that when the question of limitation was not raised before the trial court or before the High Court it could not be raised for the first time before this Court even in the hierarchy of proceedings arising from the suit when such question of limitation raised before the Court was not pure question of law but was a mixed question of law and fact. In the case of Vasudev Dhanjibhai Modi v. Rajabhai Abdul Rehman and others, reported in (1971) 1 SCR 66, J.C. Shah, J. speaking for a three- Judge Bench of this Court made the following pertinent observation in connection with the jurisdiction of the executing court, when called upon the execute the decree and on the question as to under what circumstances the executing court can go behind the decree sought to be executed. The observation at page 68 of the report deserves to be extracted in extenso:

""6. Court executing a decree cannot go behind the decree : between the parties or their representatives it must take the decree according to its tenor, and cannot entertain any objection that the decree was incorrect in law or on facts. Until it is set aside by an appropriate proceeding in appeal or revision, a decree even if it be erroneous is still binding between the parties. When a decree which is a nullity, for instance, where it is passed without bringing the legal representatives on the record of a person who was dead at the date of the decree, or against a ruling prince without a certificate, is sought to be executed an objection in that behalf may be raised in a proceeding for execution. Again, when the decree is made by a Court which has no inherent jurisdiction to make it, objection as to its validity may be raised in an Page No.# 7/21 execution proceeding if the objection appears on the face of the record : where the objection as to the jurisdiction of the Court to pass the decree does not appear on the face of the record and requires examination of the questions raised and decided at the trial or which could have been but have not been raised, the executing Court will have no jurisdiction to entertain an objection as to the validity of the decree even on the ground of absence of jurisdiction. In Jnanendra Mohan Bhaduri and another v. Rabindra Nath Chakravarti the Judicial Committee held that where a decree was passed upon an award made under the provisions of the Indian Arbitration Act, 1899, an objection in the course of the execution proceeding that the decree was made without jurisdiction, since under the Indian Arbitration Act, 1899, there is no provision for making a decree upon an award, was competent. That was a case in which the decree was on the face of the record without jurisdiction.""

The learned counsel also referred to the judgment of this High Court passed in the case of Milan Kanti Das -versus- Pandav Chandra Paul, reported in 2013(1) GLT

476. The contents of the paragraph-16 of the judgment are reproduced here below;

""16. The petitioner judgment-debtor neither challenged the decree as nullity nor said that the decree in question cannot be executed in his petition under section 47 of the Code for want of jurisdiction, and in absence of such challenge the executing Court has no other option except to execute the decree. The aforesaid views of this Court het support from the decision of the Apex Court in Vasudev Dhankibhar Modi -versus Rajabhai Abdul Rehman and Others, reported in AIR 1970 SC 1475 wherein the Apex Court noted, inter alia, ""A Court executing a decree cannot go behind the decree :
between the parties or their representatives it must take the decree according to its tenor, and cannot entertain any objection that the decree was incorrect in law or on facts. Until it is set aside by an appropriate proceeding in appeal or revision, a decree even if it be erroneous is still binding between the parties.
In the said decision, the Apex Court also noted that when the decree is made by a Court which has no inherent jurisdiction to make it, objection as to its validity may be raised in an execution proceeding if the invalidity appears on the face of the record: where the objection as to the jurisdiction of the Court to pass the decree does not appear on the face of the record and requires examination of the questions raised and decided at the trial or which could have been but have not been raised, the Executing Court will have no jurisdiction to entertain an objection as to the validity of the decree even on the ground of absence of jurisdiction"".
Page No.# 8/21
5. The learned counsel further submitted that the Executing Court which is none other than the court which passed the decree cannot declare its own decree a nullity, it is the appellate court which only has the jurisdiction to do so. Therefore, the impugned order is erroneous and against the settled principles of law. In support of his submission, the learned counsel referred to paragraph-8 of the judgment passed in the case of Rafique Bibi (dead) by LRs. -versus- Sayed Waliuddin (dead) by LRs. & Others, reported in (2004) 1 SCC 287. The contents of the paragraph-8 are reproduced here below;
""8. A distinction exists between a decree passed by a Court having no jurisdiction and consequently being a nullity and not executable and a decree of the Court which is merely illegal or not passed in accordance with the procedure laid down by law. A decree suffering from illegality or irregularity of procedure, cannot be termed inexecutable by the executing Court; the remedy of a person aggrieved by such a decree is to have it set aside in a duly constituted legal proceedings or by a superior Court failing which he must obey the command of the decree. A decree passed by a Court of competent jurisdiction cannot be denuded of its efficacy by any callateral attack or in incidental proceeding"".
6. It is also submitted by the learned counsel that when the question of jurisdiction of civil court is raised the courts would normally lean in favour of the construction which would uphold retention of jurisdiction of the civil court. The burden of proof in cases where jurisdiction of a civil court is questioned lies with the party who asserts that civil court's jurisdiction is ousted. However, in this case, the respondents (the decree debtors) failed to discharge such burden. Therefore, the Executing Court has committed error in having held that the trial court has no jurisdiction. In support of his submission, the learned counsel referred to paragraph-22 of the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case Page No.# 9/21 of Dwarka Prasad Agarwal & Another -versus- Ramesh Chander Agarwal & Others, reported in (2003) 6 SCC 220. The contents of the paragraph-22 are reproduced here below;
""22. The dispute between the parties was eminently a civil dispute and not a dispute under the provisions of the Companies Act. Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure confers jurisdiction upon the civil courts to determine all dispute of civil nature unless the same is barred under a statute either expressly or by necessary implication. Bar of jurisdiction of a civil court is not to be readily inferred. A provision seeking to bar jurisdiction of civil court requires strict interpretation. The court, it is well-settled, would normally lean in favour of construction, which would uphold retention of jurisdiction of the civil court. The burden of proof in this behalf shall be on the party who asserts that the civil court's jurisdiction is ousted. (See Sahebgouda (dead) by Lrs. and others vs. Ogeppa and others (2003(3) Supreme 13). Even otherwise, the civil court's jurisdiction is not completely ousted under the Companies Act, 1956.""
7. The learned counsel for the petitioner also submitted that the vehicle hired by the petitioner for carrying his timber was detained for a long time and for that he had to pay the hiring charge for every passing day. Besides, his timber which would have sold in good value in the market if sold in time have been damaged by the sun and rain due to the seizure and detention made by the respondents. Therefore, the petitioner had to seek a remedy from a competent civil court. Anybody having a grievance has a remedy under the law and that is why he approached the civil court for redressal of his grievances. Therefore, the Executing Court should have executed the decree.
The learned counsel further submitted that it was only the civil court who has the jurisdiction to give compensation and not the Forest department. In support of his submission, the learned counsel referred to paragraph-11 of the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Bhagubhai Dhanabhai Khalasi & Another -versus- State of Gujarat & Others, reported in (2007) 4 SCC 241. The contents of the paragraph-11 of the judgment Page No.# 10/21 are reproduced here below;

""11. In Dwarka Prasad Agarwal (D) by Lrs. and Another v Ramesh Chander Agarwal and Others [(2003) 6 SCC 220], this Court held;
""22. The dispute between the parties was eminently a civil dispute and not a dispute under the provisions of the Companies Act. Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure confers jurisdiction upon the civil courts to determine all disputes of civil nature unless the same is barred under a statute either expressly or by necessary implication. Bar of jurisdiction of a civil court is not to be readily inferred. A provision seeking to bar jurisdiction of a civil court requires strict interpretation. The court, it is well settled, would normally lean in favour of construction, which would uphold retention of jurisdiction of the civil court. The burden of proof in this behalf shall be on the party who asserts that the civil courts jurisdiction is ousted. (See Sahebgouda v. Ogeppa) Even otherwise, the civil courts jurisdiction is not completely ousted under the Companies Act, 1956.""
The learned counsel further submitted that since the petitioner had a grievance of civil nature he has the right to institute a civil suit in a competent civil court and the civil court has the jurisdiction to try such case since there is no express or implied bar by any statute. In support of his submission, the learned counsel referred to the paragraph-12, 13 & 14 of the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation & Another -versus- Bal Mukund Bairwa (2), reported in (2009) 4 SCC 299. The contents of the three paragraphs are reproduced here below;

""12. Section 9 of the Code is in enforcement of the fundamental principles of law laid down in the maxim Ubi jus Ibi remedium. A litigant, thus, having a grievance of a civil nature has a right to institute a civil suit in a competent civil court unless its cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred by any statute. Ex facie, in terms of Section 9 of the Code, civil courts can try all suits, unless bared by statute, either expressly or by necessary implication.
13. The civil court, furthermore, being a court of plenary jurisdiction has the jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction upon considering the averments made in the plaint but that would not mean that the plaintiff can circumvent the provisions of law in order to invest jurisdiction on the civil court although it otherwise may not possess. For the said purpose, the court in given cases would be entitled to decide the question of its own jurisdiction upon arriving at a finding in regard to the existence of the jurisdictional fact.
Page No.# 11/21
14. It is also well settled that there is a presumption that a civil court will have jurisdiction and the ouster of civil court's jurisdiction is not to be readily inferred. A person taking a plea contra must establish the same. Even in a case where jurisdiction of a civil court is sought to be barred under a statute, the civil court can exercise its jurisdiction in respect of some matters particularly when the statutory authority or Tribunal acts without jurisdiction"".
The learned counsel also referred to paragraph-17 of the judgment passed by this High Court in the case of Muslim Ali & Another -versus- Ashok Leyland Finance Limited & Others, reported in 2012 (5) GLT 184. The contents of the paragraph-17 are reproduced here below;

""(17) There is no doubt that fraud and justice never dwell together (Fraus et jus nunquam cohabitant). It is a settled principle that fraud and deceit defend or excuse no man (Fraus et dolus nemini patrocinari debent). It is also a settled law that the Civil Court has inherent jurisdiction to decide any dispute of civil nature concerning parties in particular facts and circumstances of the case though it would apparently appear that such Civil Court is expressly or implicitly barred to entertain such suit. The decision by the Civil Court has to be taken on particular facts and circumstances of the case where it would amount gross miscarriage of justice unless a civil suit is entertained. In all the above reported cases, specific particulars of forgery and fraud were brought on record but in the case in hand no such particulars of forgery or fraud prima facie brought on record. Whatever has been alleged in the Title Suit or in the petition before this Court are of facts which ought to be stated before the Arbitrator while the arbitration proceeding was entertained but the petitioners waived their right as they did not participate in the arbitral proceeding"".
8. The learned counsel also submitted that the Forest department has the power to seize wood or timber which are illegally sold or transported and also have the power to confiscate them if found to be illegally sold or transported. But in this case, the timbers were grown in a non-forest land of the petitioner for which due permission was granted and all formalities under the Forest Law were complied with even while transporting the same. Therefore, there was no reason why the timbers of the petitioner and the truck hired by him should have been Page No.# 12/21 detained or seized. Even if it is assumed for a moment that the Forest department had a reason to seize and detained the timbers and the truck they should have proceeded as per the law provided but that did not happen in this case and that has led to huge monetary loss to the petitioner which cannot be redressed under the Forest Act but only through civil court. Therefore, there is nothing wrong in the decree passed by the learned trial court.

The learned counsel further submitted that the case before the civil court was on compensation and not on confiscation, therefore, the learned civil court was very much within its jurisdiction in passing the judgment and decree. The learned counsel referred to paragraph-6 of the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ramesh Gobindram (deceased by LRs.) -versus- Sugra Humayun Mirza Wakf, reported in AIR 2010 SC 2897 in support of his submission. The contents of the paragraph-6 are reproduced here below;

""6. Even in cases where the statute accords finality to the orders passed by the Tribunals, the Court will have to see whether the Tribunal has the power to grant the reliefs which the Civil Courts would normally grant in suits filed before them. If the answer is in negative exclusion of the Civil Courts jurisdiction would not be ordinarily inferred. In Rajasthan SRTC v. Bal Mukund Bairwa (2), (2009) 4 SCC 299, a three-Judge Bench of this Court observed:
""There is a presumption that a civil court has jurisdiction. Ouster of civil court's jurisdiction is not to be readily inferred. A person taking a plea contra must establish the same. Even in a case where jurisdiction of a civil court is sought to be barred under a statute, the civil court can exercise its jurisdiction in respect of some matters particularly when the statutory authority or tribunal acts without jurisdiction.""
9. Mr. S. Biswas, learned counsel appearing for all the respondents submitted at the very outset that the civil court passed the judgment and decree without jurisdiction, therefore, the judgment & decree is a nullity and it is not executable. To demonstrate, the learned counsel Page No.# 13/21 thereafter referred to section-49 of the Assam Forest Regulation, 1891 and submitted that the timbers of the petitioner and the truck used were seized under this provision and under this provision it is the Forest Officers who are competent to decide whether an offence has been committed or not and whether to confiscate the timber and the vehicle used for transporting the same. Thereafter, in case, the owner of the timber is not satisfied he may appeal before the District Judge under section-49(c) of the same regulation, therefore, the petitioner should have approached the forest authorities for release of his timbers and truck but instead filed the civil suit in the civil court which has no jurisdiction on the matter.
The learned counsel further submitted that the petitioner was authorized to carry only 50 pieces of timbers but he was found carrying 152 pieces. As such, the concerned officer of Forest department were of the view that he had violated the provision of section-40 of the Assam Forest Regulation (Regulation VII of 1891). Therefore, the timbers and the truck used for transporting the same were seized and a report was submitted to the Divisional Forest Officer-cum-authorized Officer, Hailakandi Division. And thereafter, the offence report was drawn up and submitted to the authorized officer i.e. Divisional Forest Officer, Hailakandi, for confiscation proceeding under section-49 of the Assam Forrest Regulation and it was thereafter that the order No. M/12 of 2010, dated 10.05.2011 was passed by the authorized officer wherein the excess timbers of 76 pieces were confiscated and 50 pieces of timbers covered under transport permit issued were released to the owner and the vehicle used for carrying the timbers was released and the petitioner was fined a sum of Rs. 5,000/-. Therefore, if the petitioner was not satisfied with the order of the authorized officer under the regulation he should have gone on appeal to the District Judge and not resort to filing of the civil suit to a civil court which has no jurisdiction.

Page No.# 14/21 The learned counsel further submitted that no compensation can be given to the petitioner in a case like this as the same is barred by section-45(3) of the Assam Forest Regulation, 1891. The learned counsel in support of his submission referred to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Vasudev Dhanjibhai Modi -versus- Rajabhai Abdul Reehman & Others, reported in 1970(1) SCC 670, the relevant paragraph is paragraph- 7. This judgment has been already cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner and it has been already reproduced.

10. In reply, the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that in the trial before the civil court no pleading was made by the respondents as to the alleged lack of jurisdiction of the trial court. The learned counsel also submitted that confiscation can take place only when the person who is associated with the timber is convicted. In this case, the petitioner was not convicted, therefore, the question of confiscation of his timbers does not arise. In support of his submission, the learned counsel cited the judgment passed in the case of Nathuni Singh

-versus- Deputy Commissioner & Another, reported in 1999 (3) GLT 604. The contents of the relevant paragraphs-1 to 4 are reproduced here below;

""1. This revision petition has been filed by Nathuni Singh only against the order of the Deputy Commissioner, Karbi Anglong, Diphu dated 19.07.91. The case of t he prosecution in brief was that on the night of 23.10.90 Forest staff caught red handed Truck No. NLN 1939 along with its driver Surendra Kumar Das and some labourers. Ruck was alleged to have been loaded with six pieces of logs and was proceeding towards Dimapur in a clandestine manner through jungle route avoiding forest check. According to the case of the prosecution the logs were brought from Daldoli Reserve Forest. The said truck and logs were seized and the accused persons were arrested. The petitioner was admittedly not present and was summoned at a later stage, he being the owner of truck.
2. The learned trial court after found only Surendra Kumar Das guilty of the offences under section 25/40/41 of the Assam Forest Regulation. The petitioner has admittedly not been found guilty of any offence whatsoever. He has been Page No.# 15/21 acquitted primarily on the ground that there was no direct involvement proved against him. However, the learned Deputy Commissioner while invoking the provision of section 51 of Assam Forest Regulation ordered the confiscation of the truck belonging to the petitioner to the State. It was ordered that the truck be auctioned.
3. The counsel for the petitioner Mr. J. M. Choudhury, senior advocate has argued that once the petitioner has been acquitted of the charge, his truck could not be confiscated. The argument has got force and deserves to be accepted. A bare reading of section 51 of the Assam Forest Regulation 1891 makes it clear that the convicting court order the confiscation of the truck used in the commission of the offence on finding owner guilty. The word any 'person' if convicted of a forest offence clearly envisages that section 51 would come into play only if a 'person; is convicted of forest offence. If the petitioner had been convicted of any forest offence only then. Section 51 could be resorted to for ordering confiscation. Section 51 in view of the innocence of the petitioner could not be invoked by the learned Deputy Commissioner. This is the only interpretation which can be given to section 51.
4. For the reasons recorded above the revision petition is allowed. The order of the Deputy Commissioner, in so far as it pertains the petitioner, is hereby set aside.
11. I have considered the submissions of the learned counsel in the light of the facts and circumstances of the case and the relevant laws. Section-40 of the Assam Forest Regulation, 1891 empowers the State Government to control all the forest produce in transit by land or water and also to make rules to regulate the transit of any forest produce and such rules may prohibit the import, export, collection or moving of forest produce without a pass from an officer authorized to issue the same, or otherwise than in accordance with the conditions of such pass and when the rules made there under are violated such forest produce together with all tools, boats, motorized boats, vessels, cattle, carts, rafts, machinaries, vehicles, trucks, ropes, chains or any other implements, articles or materials used in the commission of such offence may be seized by any Forest Officer not below the rank of a Forester or any Police Officer not below the rank of a Sub-Inspector of Police under the Assam Forest Page No.# 16/21 Regulation, 1891. And after the seizure, the Officer who seized the forest produce and the tools or machinaries or vehicle is required to submit a report and produce the property seized articles before an Officer not below the rank of Assistant Conservator of Forests authorized by the State Government on that behalf by a notification in the Official Gazette, and when it is, having regard to the quantity or the bulk or of any other genuine difficulty, not practicable to produce the property seized before the Authorized Officer, or where it is intended to launch prosecution against the offender, immediately make a report of such seizure to the Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the offence on account of which the seizure has been made.

It is also provided that where the Authorized Officer upon production before him of the property seized or upon receipt of a report about seizure, as the case may be, and after such personal inspection or verification as he may deem fit and necessary, is satisfied that a forest offence has been committed in respect thereof, he may by order in writing and for reasons to be recorded therein, confiscate the forest produce so seized together with all tools, vehicles, cattle, trucks, motorized boats, carts, rafts, vessels, ropes, chains or any other implements or articles used in committing such offence. A copy of the order of confiscation shall, without any undue delay be forwarded to the Circle Conservator of Forests of the Circle in which the forest produce has been seized and the Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the offence on account of which the seizure has been made. But such order confiscating property should be passed by the Authorised Officer only after intimation in the prescribed form about the initiation of the proceeding for confiscation of property to the Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the offence on account of which the seizure has been made and issue a notice in writing to the person from whom the property is seized, and such person is given a reasonable opportunity of making a representation. Against the order passed under the provision of Page No.# 17/21 section-49 any person aggrieved may approach the Conservator of Forest specially empowered by the State Government under section 49-C or may approach the District Judge under section 49-B by way of filing an appeal. The provisions of section 49, 49-B and 49-C are given here below;

""49. Seizure of property liable to confiscation. (1) When there is reason to believe that a forest offence has been committed in respect of nay forest procedure, such produce together all tools, boats, carts and cattle used in the commission of such alleged offence may be seized by any Forest Officer or Police Officer.
(2) Every office seizing any property under this section shall place on such property, or the receptacle, if any, in which it is contained a mark indicating that the same has been so seized, and shall as soon as may be, make a report of such seizure to the Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the person accused of the offence on account of which the seizure has been made:
Provided when the forest-produce with respect to which such offence is believed to have been committed is the property of the Government and the offender is unknown, it shall be sufficient if the officer makes, as soon as may be, a report of the circumstances to his official superiors. (3) Any Forest Officer or Police Officer may, if he has reason to believe that a vehicle has been or is being used for the transport of any forest produce in respect of which any forest offence has been committed, require the driver or any other person or persons in-charge of such vehicle to stop the vehicle and cause it to remain stationary as long as may reasonably be necessary to examine the contents in the vehicle and inspect all records relating to the goods carried, which are in possession of such driver or other person in charge of the vehicle.
(4) Subject to the provisions of sub-Sections (5) and (6), where the authorised Officer upon production before him of the property seized or upon receipt of a report about seizure as the case may be, and after such personal inspection or verification as he may deem fit and necessary, is satisfied that a forest offence has been committed in respect thereof, he may, by order in writing and for reasons to be recorded therein, confiscate the forest produce so seized together with all tools, vehicles, cattle, trucks, motorised boats, carts, machineries, rafts, vessels, ropes, chains or any other implements or articles used in committing such offence. A copy of the order of confiscation shall, without any undue delay, be forwarded to the Circle Conservator of Forests of the Circle in which the forest produce has been seized and the Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the offence on account of which the seizure has been made.
(5) No order confiscating any property shall be made under the preceding provisions unless the authorised officer-",lb

2. Being aggrieved of their conviction and the sentences awarded to them, the appellants Karni Singh and Sarjeet Singh have preferred these two appeals under Section 374 (2) CrPC. As the appeals arise out of a single judgment, they are being heard and decided together.

(3 of 21) [CRLA-484/2016]

3. Brief facts relevant and essential for disposal of the appeals are noted hereinbelow. The complainant Taruram Nayak (P.W.1) approached the Police Station Bichhwal, District Bikaner on 17.03.2010 at 1.00 p.m. and submitted a written report (Ex.P/1) alleging inter alia that his uncle Magharam Nayak was a shepherd by profession. On 16.03.2010 in the morning at about 9 o'clock he went from the village for grazing the goats. He was having about 60 to 70 head of goats, out of which, 35 belonged to the complainant. Magharam did not return home in the evening after grazing the goats, on which, the complainant became worried and in the next morning, i.e. on 17.03.2010, he went to Rohi of Village Kanasar to look out for Magharam and his goats. A search was made near the field of Prithvi Singh and the 44 puliya, but it did not prove fruitful. When the complainant reached the Village Kanasar, Arjun Singh Rajput (P.W.7) told him that his uncle's dead body was lying underneath the shrubs in the field of Mohabbat Singh. Arjun Singh also told the complainant that the signs of violence and dragging of the dead body were visible at the place of incident. On receiving this information, the complainant proceeded to the spot and found that what Arjun Singh had stated was true. By looking at the Magharam's dead body, he realized that someone had killed him by giving blows on his head. The goats sent to graze with Magharam had strayed and were found near the Village Khara. It was, thus, alleged that his uncle Magharam had been murdered by some unknown person in the evening at about 4 to 5 o'clock on 16.03.2010.

4. On the basis of the aforesaid report, an FIR No.52/2010 (Ex.P/2) came to be registered at the Police Station Bichhwal, Bikaner for the offence under Section 302 IPC.

5. The initial investigation was conducted by Ishwar Prasad (P.W.14), SHO, Police Station Bichhwal, who inspected the place of incident and prepared the following documents :-

     Site inspection plan                                     -        Ex.P/3
     Site inspection memo                                     -        Ex.P/3A

The body was then handed over to the complainant for cremation (Ex.P/14).

6. The accused Karni Singh was arrested on 21.03.2010 vide arrest memo (Ex.P/22) and the accused Sarjeet Singh was arrested on 23.03.2010 vide arrest memo (Ex.P/23) in presence of Brahmprakash, A.S.I. and Virendra Singh, Constable, posted at the Police Station Bichhwal, Bikaner. The Investigating Officer Ishwar Prasad also proceeded there and recorded the statement of various witnesses.

7. As the offence under Section 3 (2)(v) of the SC/ST Act was made out, Ishwar Prasad handed over further investigation to Sarjeet Singh (P.W.16), C.O., Circle Sadar Bikaner, who verified the documents prepared by Ishwar Singh. He allegedly recovered a bamboo stick at the instance of accused Karni Singh which was seized vide seizure memo (Ex.P/16). He also claims to have recovered and seized an iron axe at the instance of accused Karni Singh vide seizure memo (Ex.P/17). The Investigating Officer further proceeded to recover 25 goat skins from the possession of the accused Sarjeet Singh and seized the same vide seizure memo (Ex.P/20).

8. After concluding the investigation, the Investigating Officer proceeded to file a charge-sheet in the Court of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bikaner against the accused Karni Singh for the offences under Sections 302, 394, 397 IPC and Section 3 (2) (v) of the SC/ST Act against the accused Sarjeet Singh for the offences under Sections 411 and 429 (6 of 21) [CRLA-484/2016] IPC. The case was then committed to the learned Special Judge, SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities Cases), Court, Bikaner, for trial, who framed charges against the accused in the same terms. The accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution examined as many as 16 witnesses and exhibited 62 documents to prove its case.

9. It may be stated here that during the course of investigation, the blood stained and control articles seized from the place of incident, moulds of shoe impression of unknown person seized from the spot and the specimen food-moulds of the shoes worn by the accused Karni Singh were forwarded to the FSL for analysis and analysis reports were received. The FSL report of the foot-moulds was exhibited as (Ex.P/61), whereas the FSL Report of the blood-stained and control articles was exhibited as (Ex.P/62).

10. The accused, upon being questioned under Section 313 CrPC and when confronted with the prosecution allegations, denied the same and claimed to be innocent. 6 documents were exhibited, but no oral evidence was led in defence.

11. Upon hearing and considering the arguments advanced by the prosecution and by the defence and after appreciating (7 of 21) [CRLA-484/2016] the evidence available on record, the learned special court convicted and sentenced the accused appellants as above.

12. Mr. S.K. Verma, learned counsel representing the appellant Karni Singh and Mr. D.S. Gharsana, learned counsel representing the appellant Sarjeet Singh, vehemently and fervently urged that the impugned judgment is bad in the facts as well as in law. There is no legal evidence worth the name on the entire record, which can be considered sufficient to connect the appellants with the alleged offence. There was no material with the Investigating Officer on the basis whereof, he could have arrested the accused- appellants. The so-called motive of looting of the goats attributed to the accused Karni Singh for murder of deceased is falsified from the very fact mentioned in the FIR that the goats were found near the Village Khara on the next day. It was further contended that evidence of the so-called witness of the circumstance of last seen, namely, Kaluram (P.W.3) is totally unreliable because he simply stated that he had seen Magharam and Karni Singh going together for grazing goats at about 12 o'clock with sticks in their hands. It was contended that the witness had reached the place of incident on 17.03.2010 before the report came to be filed with the police, yet he did not divulge this important fact to the police that he had seen the deceased and the accused Karni Singh going together on 16.03.2010. As per the learned counsel, the witness stated that he used to go for his labour job, the (8 of 21) [CRLA-484/2016] timing whereof was from 8 o'clock in the morning till 5 o'clock in the evening. Thus, as per Mr. Verma, the possibility of this witness having seen the accused Karni Singh proceeding with Magharam at about 12 o'clock on 16.03.2010 is virtually non-existent. Mr. Verma further submitted that Sattar Khan (P.W.5) stated in his cross- examination that Kaluram told him that the dead body of Magharam was lying in the field of Mohabbat Singh and thus, Kaluram was conscious of the murder of Magharam, yet he did not disclose to anyone that he had lastly seen the accused Karni Singh in the company of deceased Magharam on the day of the incident. Mr. Verma submitted in arguendo that that even if the statement of Kaluram is accepted for the sake of argument, then too it is not a conclusive proof of the fact that the accused and the deceased were seen in each other's company soon before Magharam was murdered. As per Mr. Verma, possibility of the deceased and the accused parting company and having proceeded to their respective destinations after they were allegedly seen together by Kaluram cannot be ruled out and thus, his contention was that the circumstance of last seen does not lend any credibility to the prosecution theory that the accused-appellant was solely responsible for homicidal death of Magharam. Mr. Verma further contended that the trial court committed grave error while appreciating the evidence and holding that the prosecution proved the factum of recoveries of the blood-stained lathi and the blood-stained Kulhadi at the instance of the accused Karni Singh. His (9 of 21) [CRLA-484/2016] contention was that the Investigating Officer did not prove the informations allegedly recorded at the instance of the accused as required by law because the verbatim language of the informations allegedly given by the accused under Section 27 of the Evidence Act (which led to the recoveries) was not elaborately stated by the Investigating Officer in his evidence and hence, the information lose credibility and the recoveries made in furtherance thereof cannot be held proved. He further submitted that only police personnel were associated as motbirs while effecting the recoveries and as such also, the recoveries are tainted. Mr. Verma further submitted that the recovery of the goat skins effected by the Investigating Officer has also not been proved as per law and as such, the same has to be discarded. Mr. Verma further submitted that the prosecution theory regarding the collection of the foot-moulds of the shoes worn by the accused, which were later on compared with the suspect's foot-moulds found at the place of incident has also not been proved as per law and beyond all manner of doubt.

13. Mr. D.S. Gharsana, learned counsel representing the appellant Sarjeet Singh, urged that there is no material whatsoever available on record of the case to establish that the goat skins recovered from the premises of the accused were of the goats, which were being grazed by the deceased Magharam and were allegedly stolen after murdering him.


      He submitted that the goat                      skins       had    no   particular



                                         (10 of 21)                   [CRLA-484/2016]


      identifying marks.         The first informant Taruram clearly

stated in the report that the goats returned back to the village a day after the dead body of Magharam was recovered. Thus, as per Mr. Gharsana, there is nothing on record, which can be considered sufficient to establish that the goat skins allegedgly recovered from the premises of accused Sarjeet Singh were connected with the offence in any manner. Mr. Gharsana further submitted that admittedly, the accused Sarjeet is involved in the business of buying and selling skins of goats and as such, in absence of any evidence to show that the skins recovered from his premises were those of the goats allegedly looted from Magharam, no inference can be drawn that he received the skins knowing them to be stolen. On these grounds, leaned counsel craved acceptance of the appeals and sought acquittal of the accused appellants.

14. Per contra, learned Public Prosecutor vehemently and fervently opposed the submissions advanced by the appellant's counsel. He urged that the prosecution has proved all the circumstances invariably pointing towards the guilt of the accused by clinching, cogent and convincing evidence. The witness Kaluram gave positive evidence establishing the fact that the accused Karni Singh was lastly seen walking besides Magharam and the latter who was not seen alive thereafter. The incriminating recoveries of the weapons and the fact that the foot-moulds of the suspect (11 of 21) [CRLA-484/2016] found at the place of incident matched with the foot-moulds of the shoes seized from the person of Karni Singh and the circumstance of recovery of the goat skins effected from the premises of Sarjeet Singh in furtherance of the information provided by the accused to the Investigating Officer under Section 27 of the Evidence Act are conclusive and sufficient to establish their guilt. Also, regarding the appeal of Sarjeet Singh, the contention of the learned Public Prosecutor was that he failed to offer any plausible explanation for being in possession of the goat skins, which were removed from the goats being grazed by Magharam and which Taruram identified to be of his goats and as such, learned Public Prosecutor's contention was that the learned trial court was absolutely justified in convicting and sentencing the appellants by the impugned judgment. He sought dismissal of the appeal on the strength of these submissions.

15. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the submissions advanced at Bar and have gone through the material available on record. It cannot be disputed that there is no eye-witness to the incident and the entire prosecution case is based wholly on circumstantial evidence. The prosecution portrayed the circumstances of last seen and motive of recoveries so as to make an endeavour of bringing home the guilt of the accused.

(12 of 21) [CRLA-484/2016]

16. Evidence of the deceased being lastly seen in the company of the accused Karni Singh was deposed by Kaluram (P.W.3). On a threadbare appreciation of the statement of this witness, it is clear that he claimed to have seen the deceased Magharam and the accused Karni Singh going together with the herds of goats. The witness claimed that he came to know of the murder of Magharam 3 to 4 days after the incident and thereafter, he came to the village and gave the statement to this effect to the police. He also stood as a motbir in the recovery of the goat skins. In his cross- examination, he admitted that he was working as a labourer in the factories and his duty hours were 8 o'clock in the morning to 5 o'clock in the evening. The witness resiled from certain portions of his police statement (Ex.D/2). In the portion marked 'A' to 'B' of his police statement, it is recorded that he heard in the village on 17.03.2010 that Magharam had been murdered by some unknown person in the field of Mohabbat Singh by inflicting injuries on his head. This significant omission elicited from the previous statement of the witness brings his testimony under a severe cloud of doubt. The confronted portion of his police statement (Ex.D/2) clearly indicates that the witness came to know on 17.03.2010 itself that Magharam had been killed. If this was so, natural human conduct demanded that the witness should have immediately divulged to the family members of the deceased as well as to the police that he had seen the deceased and the accused going together. The witness tried to modulate the facts in his evidence claiming that he came (13 of 21) [CRLA-484/2016] back to the village after 3 days. However, this fact is not mentioned in his police statement (Ex.D/2), with which, he was confronted during his cross-examination. Thus, we have no hesitation in holding that the witness has been cooked up to give evidence of last seen. He was purely a chance witness and his statement is neither trustworthy nor reliable. Thus, the circumstance of last seen relied upon by the prosecution deserves to be discarded.

17. The next circumstance, which the prosecution alleged against the accused Karni Singh was that of motive, i.e. the looting of the goats being grazed by Magharam. In this regard, we have to remain conscious of the testimony of Taruram (P.W.1) and more particularly of the fact mentioned by him in the FIR that the goats, which Magharam had taken for grazing, were recovered near Village Khara on the day next to the recovery of the dead body, i.e. on 17.03.2010, which by itself is sufficient to satisfy the court that the prosecution theory regarding the goats having been looted, is nothing but a figment of imagination. The next circumstance, which the prosecution relied upon against the accused Karni Singh, was that of the recovery of the blood- stained weapons. In this regard, we would like to refer to the statement of the Investigating Officer Sarjeet Singh (P.W.16). Being conscious of the fact that the trial court placed implicit reliance on his testimony, the examination-in- chief of the Investigating Officer, who claimed to have (14 of 21) [CRLA-484/2016] effected recoveries is reproduced in verbatim for the sake of convenience :

On a bare perusal of the statement of Mr. Sarjeet Singh (P.W.16), it is clear that he did not even utter a single word so as to elaborate upon the informations allegedly given by the accused to him under Section 27 of the Evidence Act. He made a bald statement and exhibited the informations as Ex.P/55 and Ex.P/56. This court, in the case of Daau Ram Vs. State of Rajasthan [2019 (3) RLW 1843 (Raj.)] has conclusively held that for an information under Section 27 of the Evidence Act to be admitted in evidence, the police officer concerned must depose the contents thereof verbatim during his sworn testimony. A casual statement that the accused gave the information, which was being marked as an exhibit, would not amount to a lawful proof of the information. Apparently, the Investigating Officer would have recorded the informations during interrogation of the accused and thus, he would be the prime witness to prove the same. He would, thus, be required to narrate verbatim or at least in substance, the contents thereof, only whereafter, such informations could be treated as having been proved as per law. If the Investigating Officer fails, during his testimony to elaborate the details of the information given to him by the accused under Section 27 of the Evidence Act, a formal marking of the memorandum as an exhibit would not fulfill the requirement of law and the information would have to be treated as not proved. As observed above, in the case at hand, the Investigating (17 of 21) [CRLA-484/2016] Officer Sarjeet Singh (P.W.16) made a bald formality of marking exhibits on the informations under Section 27 of the Evidence Act in his evidence without deposing the words spoken to him by the accused and thus, these informations and the recoveries made in furtherance thereof are rendered inadmissible in evidence. Furthermore, the attesting witnesses associated in the recoveries effected by the Investigating Officer vide recovery memos Ex.P/16 (bamboo stick) and Ex.P/17 (axe) respectively are none other than Taruram and Choonaram, who are the close relatives of the deceased. No reason has been assigned by the prosecution agency as to why no independent witnesses were associated in these recoveries. Thus, we have no hesitation in holding that the prosecution miserably failed to prove the factum of recoveries allegedly made at the instance of the accused appellants and hence, the same cannot be read in evidence against the accused appellants.

18. Now we come to the prosecution case regarding recovery of suspected footmark moulds of the accused Karni Singh from the place of occurrence and the comparison thereof with the specimen footmark moulds of the accused and the FSL Report (Ex.P/61). In this regard, firstly, the site inspection plan (Ex.P/3) is required to be perused, where it is recorded that the dead body of the deceased Magharam was dragged from the Point 'X-1' to Point 'X-2'. The distance between the two points is noted as 95 feet in the site inspection plan. In (18 of 21) [CRLA-484/2016] the description memo of the site (Ex.P/3A), various circumstances noticed by the Investigating Officer are recorded. Mark-B is stated to be Kheep Ka Bojha (a kind of shrub). In this entire description of the site inspection plan (Ex.P/3A) prepared by the Investigating Officer, it is nowhere mentioned that any clear footmarks of the suspect were visible therein. Since the dead body was allegedly dragged in the sandy ground for 95 feet, prominent footmarks would have been imprinted nearby the track through where the deceased was dragged. However, in this entire stretch of 95 feet, no footprints were mentioned as being visible when the site inspection description memo (Ex.P/3A) was prepared.

19. Be that as it may. The SHO Mr. Ishwar Prasad (PW.14) claims to have prepared the memo (Ex.P/13) on 17.03.2010 at 05:45 pm. The foot moulds of the footwear of the suspect were shown at Mark 'B' and were lifted by Constable Girdhari Dan of MOB Team. The said Constable Girdhari Dan was not examined by the prosecution in evidence. In this background and considering the material omissions noted by us in the site inspection proceedings, no sanctity can be attached to the procedure whereby the suspect's foot moulds were collected. Furthermore, the procedure, whereby the specimen foot moulds of the accused Karni Singh were collected, is also not reliable because the Investigating Officer Ishwar Prasad (PW.14) made a bald formality of stating that the memo of seizure of foot moulds of accused Karni Singh was (Ex.P/25). Furthermore, the witnesses, who were associated as motbirs in the lifting of the specimen (19 of 21) [CRLA-484/2016] foot-moulds were noe other than the SHO Ishwar Prasad (PW.14) and Dr. Sunil Punia (PW.11), who was working in the Police Line Dispensary. Thus, no independent witness was associated in this process, which creates a doubt on the sanctity thereof. In addition thereto, we are of the view that the location, from where the foot moulds were allegedly lifted, creates a doubt in the mind of the Court that these foot moulds cannot be in any manner connected with the murder of Magharam. Thus, the foot mould examination report (Ex.P/61) is of no worth to the prosecution.

20. Now we come to the case of the accused Sarjeet Singh, who has been convicted for the offence under Section 411 IPC. In this regard, the following lines appearing in the cross- examination of the Investigating Officer Ishwar Prasad (PW.14) are relevant:

21. It is clear from this candid admission of the Investigating Officer that Taruram did not make any complaint in the FIR that the goats, which Magharam had taken to graze, had been lost or had been stolen. On the contrary, it was mentioned in the report that the goats were discovered later. Therefore, there is no satisfactory material on the record of the case to satisfy the court that the goat skins recovered from the premises were taken off from the stolen goats. The accused Sarjeet Singh was admittedly pursuing the trade of (20 of 21) [CRLA-484/2016] selling goat skins and thus, he being found in possession of the goat skins cannot be considered to be an incriminating circumstance. The goat skins did not have particular identifying marks. There is no material to satisfy the court that they have been taken off by the accused Sarjeet singh from the goats allegedly stolen.

22. In wake of the discussion made hereinabove, we are of the firm opinion that the prosecution has failed to lead appropriate evidence so as to bring home the guilt of accused for the charge of murdering the deceased Magharam and for looting the goats which he had taken to graze. The links in the chain of circumstances produced by the prosecution to bring home the charges are flimsy and unconvincing and do not lead to an unexceptional inference regarding the guilt of the accused. Thus, we are inclined to acquit the appellants while giving them the benefit of doubt.

23. Accordingly, both the appeals deserve to be and are hereby allowed. The impugned judgment dated 30.05.2016 passed by the learned Special Judge, Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities Cases), Bikaner in Sessions Case No.23/2010 is hereby quashed and set aside. The accused appellants are acquitted of the charges. The accused Sarjeet Singh is on bail. His bail bonds are discharged. The accused Karni singh is in jail. He shall be released from prison forthwith, if not wanted in any other case.

                                                                            (21 of 21)              [CRLA-484/2016]



                                   24.   However, keeping in view the provisions of Section                437-A

CrPC, each of the accused appellants is directed to furnish a personal bond in the sum of Rs.40,000/- and a surety bond in the like amount before the learned trial court, which shall be effective for a period of six months to the effect that in the event of filing of a Special Leave Petition against the present judgment on receipt of notice thereof, the appellants shall appear before the Supreme Court.

"J U D G M E N T Dipak Misra, CJI The legal representatives of the deceased Firoz preferred a claim   petition   being   MAC   Petition   No.   64   of   2006   before   the Chairman,   Motor   Accidents   Claims   Tribunal   (for   short,   âthe tribunalâ), Washim under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (for brevity, âthe Actâ) claiming compensation of Rs. 15 lacs on the foundation that the deceased was an Assistant Teacher in Urdu   Primary   School   at   Pusad   run   by   Zilla   Parishad,   Yeotmal and was drawing monthly salary of Rs. 8,123/Â­ and they were Signature Not Verified dependent on the income of the deceased.   The assertion in the Digitally signed by CHETAN KUMAR Date: 2018.07.03 16:55:20 IST Reason:

claim petition was that land situated in survey number 136 of village Kajleshwar, Tq Karanja, Washim District was belonging to Respondent No. 1 who had commenced the work for digging of well in the above agricultural land. On 08.04.2005 at about 4.15 p.m., when the deceased was returning towards his house after purchasing certain articles from the grocery shop, a heavy stone came flying and fell on his head, as a consequence of which, he sustained   grievous   injuries  and  was  carried  for   treatment  in   a jeep to the hospital where he  was declared dead. The case of the claimants   before   the   Tribunal   was   that   the   stone   fell   on   the deceased due to blasting operation carried out for digging of well in the field of respondent No. 1. It is further put forth that the tractor   belonging   to   the   1st  respondent   and   insured   with   the respondent  No.  4  was   used for  digging up well by  keeping the blasting machine and, therefore, the causing of death by the use of the tractor was established.

2. The tribunal, appreciating the materials brought on record, came to hold that digging of the well with use of blasting machine was carried on in the field of the owner and the tractor was used for digging of the well with the blasting machine.   Thereafter, it proceeded to deal with fixing of the liability and the quantum of the   compensation.   On   the   first   aspect,   it   took   note   of   the submission advanced on behalf of the insurer that the owner had committed   breach   of   the   policy   by   using   the   tractor   for commercial use.  To bolster the said stance, the insurer asserted that   the   owner   had   not   taken   permission   from   the   competent authority   for   carrying   on   the   blasting   work   in   his   field   and, hence, there was violation of the policy.  On behalf of the owner, the  stand was taken that the tractor was used for agricultural purposes, for digging of the well was carried on for the irrigation of the crops which work was incidental to agriculture and hence, there was no violation of the policy.

3. The tribunal came to hold that on the basis of the material brought on record, the vehicle was used for commercial purpose and, therefore, there was a fundamental breach of the insurance policy.   It   further   opined   that   the   cause   of   the   death   of   the deceased was due to vehicular accident because of the evidence brought   on   record.     Emphasis   was   laid   on   the   fundamental breach of the insurance policy by the owner and, ultimately the liability was fastened on him directing him and other respondent to pay the compensation of Rs. 9,30,000/Â­ with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of the petition till realization.
4. Two   appeals   were   preferred   before   the   High   Court challenging the award of the tribunal.  The High Court noted that the power for trigger of the explosives came from the battery of the   tractor   which   was   parked   nearby   and   as   explosion   took place,   a   large   stone   flew   in   air   and   fell   on   the   head   of   the deceased who was standing in front of a shop that was 300 ft. away. It addressed to the concept of âuse of motor vehicleâ and in that context stated that the tractor, when it is stationary with the additional   implements/machines   can   be   run   using   the   power generated   by   its   engine   for   thrashing   and   cutting   agriculture produce.     It   also   dwelt   upon   the   concept   that   when   a   storage battery of a vehicle is disconnected and taken for some other use, sometimes   it  is   used   for   other   purposes  without   disconnecting the   battery   from   the   vehicle.     On   the   factual   issue,   the   High Court   opined   that   the   battery   of   the   vehicle   was   still   installed inside and the terminals were used for providing power to the use of explosive. However, it further went on to say that the battery was practically detached from the vehicle and was not a part of the vehicle and on that basis ruled that use of battery for causing explosion cannot be said to be use of  vehicle, for the vehicle was not used for causing explosion. Eventually, it held that it could not be said that the accident that took place had arisen out of the use of motor vehicle as defined in Section 165 of the Act and, therefore,   the   claim   petition   under   Section   166   was   not maintainable. Expressing the aforesaid view, the High Court set aside the award passed by the tribunal.

5. We   have   heard   Ms.   Aparna   Jha,   learned   counsel   for   the appellants,   Ms.   Aishwarya   Bhati,   learned   counsel   for   the respondent No. 2 and Mr. Abhishek Kumar, learned counsel for the respondent No.  4. 

6. As is noticeable, the High Court has recorded a finding that the   battery   was   practically   detached   from   the   vehicle.   The correctness of this finding is required to be determined first. It is necessary to note here that the tribunal has treated the accident to be a vehicular accident and entertained the claim. As we find, the High Court has not analyzed any evidence brought on record to   come   to   the   conclusion   that   the   battery   of   the   vehicle   was practically detached from the vehicle and was not a part of the vehicle.   On   the   contrary,   the   Tribunal   had   noticed   that   the panchnama of the tractor, ExÂ­42, clearly showed that the tractor was in the field and the blasting machine was found on tractor with   wrapped   gas   pipe   and   an   explosive   battery   found   on   the tractor with the wooden cover.  It has referred to ExÂ­41 and other oral evidence to record the finding that the blasting machine was kept  on the  tractor driven by  the driver engaged by  the owner and the tractor was used for digging of the well with the blasting machine. The insurer, as is evident, had only raised a singular plea   with   regard   to   use   of   the   tractor,   namely,   âcommercial purposeâ and on that foundation, it had advanced the stance that there   had   been   fundamental   breach   of   the   insurance   policy. Keeping in view the evidence on record, we agree with the view expressed by the tribunal that the battery was still installed on the   vehicle   and   the   power   was   drawn   from   the   battery   for explosive purposes.   Having arrived at the aforesaid conclusion, we shall proceed to deal with the concept of âuseâ and determine whether the accident could be regarded as a vehicle accident. 

7. Section   165   deals   with   the   claims   tribunals.   It   uses   the word  âuse  of  motor  vehiclesâ. For  the sake of completeness, we reproduce the relevant part of the said provision:Â­ âSection 165. Claims Tribunals.â (1) A State Government may, by notification in the Official   Gazette,   constitute   one   or   more   Motor Accidents   Claims   Tribunals   (hereafter   in   this Chapter   referred   to   as   Claims   Tribunal)   for   such area as may be specified in the notification for the purpose   of   adjudicating   upon   claims   for compensation in respect of accidents involving the death of, or bodily injury to, persons arising out of the   use   of   motor   vehicles,   or   damages   to   any property of a third party so arising, or bothâ¦..â The aforesaid provision makes it vivid that the tribunal can adjudicate   the   claims   for  compensation  in  respect  of  accidents arising   out   of   use   of   motor   vehicles.     Thus,   the   fundamental requirement is that the accident should arise out of the use of the  motor vehicle.   If there is no use of the motor vehicle, the question of vehicular accident will not arise.

8. In this context, reference to certain definitions, as stated in the dictionary clause would be apt.  Section 2(28) defines âmotor vehicleâ or âvehicleâ. It reads as follows:Â­ â(28)   âmotor   vehicleâ   or   âvehicleâ   means   any mechanically propelled vehicle adapted for use upon roads   whether   the   power   of   propulsion   is transmitted   thereto   from   an   external   or   internal source and includes a chassis to which a body has not   been   attached   and   a   trailer;   but   does   not include   a   vehicle   running   upon   fixed   rails   or   a vehicle of a special type adapted for use only in a factory   or   in   any   other   enclosed   premises   or   a vehicle   having   less   than   four   wheels   fitted   with engine   capacity   of   not   exceeding   twentyÂ­five   cubic centimeters;""

Section 2(44) defines âtractorâ to mean a motor vehicle which is not itself constructed to carry any load (other than equipment used for the purpose of propulsion); but excludes a roadÂ­roller.
9. Keeping the aforesaid definitions in view, we are required to analyze whether the use of the vehicle in the manner in which it is done can be treated as use of the vehicle to cause a vehicular accident.   This Court in  Shivaji Dayanu Patil and another v. Smt.   Vatschala   Uttam   More1  was   dealing   with   conceptual meaning of the phrase âarising out of the use of motor vehicleâ as   contained   in   Section   92Â­A   of   the   Motor   Vehicles   Act,   1939 (hereinafter referred to as âthe 1939 Actâ). We may note with profit that Section 92Â­A(1) used the words âan accident arising out of the use of a motor vehicleâ and Section 165 of the Act that has been reproduced hereinabove also uses the words âarising out of the use of motor vehiclesâ. Thus, there has been no change in this part of the provision. 

10. In Patilâs case, there was a collision between a petrol tanker and a tractor on the national highway as a result of which, the petrol tanker went off the road and fell on its left side as a result of   its   turning   turtle,   the   petrol   contained   in   it   leaked   out   and collected nearby.  The accident took place at about 3 a.m. and at about 7.15 a.m. an explosion took place in the said petrol tanker resulting   in   fire   and   the   persons   who  had  assembled  near   the 1 (1991) 3 SCC 530 tanker   sustained   injuries   and   one   of   them   succumbed   to   the injuries.   On a claim petition being filed, the tribunal dismissed the same on the ground that the explosion could not be said to be an accident arising out of the use of the petrol tanker and that the provision of Section 92Â­A of the 1939 Act were not attracted. It expressed the view that the accident that took place at 7.15 a.m. was an independent explosion. On appeal, the learned single Judge of the High Court held that though at the material time the tanker was not being driven on the highway and was lying turtle on   its   side   on   the   highway   but   it   would   be   covered   by   the expression âuseâ as contemplated in Section 92Â­A of the 1939 Act. In   Letters   Patent   Appeal,   the   Division   Bench   opined   that   the expression âuseâ of motor vehicle covers a very wide field, a field more   extensive   than   which   might   be   called   traffic   use   of   the motor vehicle and that the use of a vehicle is not confined to the periods when it was in motion or was moving and that a vehicle would   still   be   in   use   even   when   it   was   stationary.   It   had   also expressed the view that it could not be inferred that there was no causal relation between the earlier event and the later incident of explosion   and   fire   and   further,   the   earlier   collision   if   not   the cause,   was   at   least   the   main   contributory   factor   for   the subsequent   explosion.   Being   of   this   view,   the   Division   Bench affirmed the judgment of the learned single Judge. 

11. This Court referred to the Statement of Objects and Reasons for   introduction   of   Section   92Â­A   to   Section   92Â­E   of   the   Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 1982. Analyzing, Chapter VIIÂ­A of the 1939   Act   which   was   amended   by   Act   47   of   1982   dealt   with âLiability without fault in certain casesâ,   the Court referred to the anatomy of Section 92Â­A, the purpose behind it, the concept of   beneficial   legislation   and   proceeded   to   interpret   the   words âarising out of the use of motor vehicleâ. Be it noted, on behalf of the petitioners therein, a contention was raised that the tanker had   ceased   to   be   a   mechanically   propelled   vehicle.   The   Court relied on the decision in Newberry v. Simmonds2 wherein it was held   that   the   motor   car   does   not   cease   to   be   a   mechanically propelled   vehicle   upon   the   mere   removal   of   the   engine   if   the evidence   admits   the   possibility   that   engine   may   shortly   be replaced   and   the   moving   power   restored.     The   Court   further referred to the authority in Smart v. Allan3 where the defendant had brought a car for Â£ 2 and subsequently sold it as scrap for 30 cents. It was found that the engine was in a rusty condition 2 [1961] 2 ALL ER 318 3 [1962] 3 ALL ER 893 and was incomplete and it did not work, and there was no gearÂ­ box   or   electric   batteries;   and   the   car   was   incapable   of   moving under its own power, having been towed from place to place and that   it   could   only   have   been   put   in   running   order   again   by supplying   a   considerable   number   of   spare   parts   and   effecting considerable repairs, the cost of which would have been out of all proportion   to   its   value.   It   was   contended   before   the   House   of Lords  that  every  vehicle  which starts its life as a mechanically propelled vehicle remains as such until it is physically destroyed. The   said   submission   was   rejected   by   Lord   Parker,   CJ   who observed thus:Â­ ââ¦   it   seems   to   me   as   a   matter   of   common   sense that some limit must be put, and some stage must be reached, when one can say: âThis is so immobile that   it   has   ceased   to   be   a   mechanically   propelled vehicleâ. Where, as in the present case, and unlike Newberry   v.   Simmonds,   there   is   no   reasonable prospect   of   the   vehicle   ever   being   made   mobile again, it seems to me that, at any rate at that stage, a vehicle has ceased to be a mechanically propelled vehicle.â This   Court   agreed   with   the   aforesaid   formulation   and reasoning and came to hold that the petrol tanker had not ceased to be a motor vehicle.  

12. The twoÂ­Judge Bench thereafter proceeded to interpret the expression   âuse   of   the   motor   vehicleâ,   for   it   was   urged   that   a vehicular   accident   could   only   take   place   when   the   vehicle   is mobile.   

13. Learned counsel for the petitioner therein urged for placing a narrow meaning on the word âuseâ by confining it to a situation only when the vehicle is mobile.  On behalf of the respondent, it was suggested that a wider connotation for the word âuseâ should be   taken   so   as   to   include   the   period   when   the   vehicle   is stationary.   On behalf of the respondents, observations made in Elliott v. Grey4,  Government Insurance Office of New South Wales v. R.J. Green & Lloyd Pty. Ltd.5, Pushpa Rani Chopra v.   Anokha   Singh6,  General   Manager,   K.S.R.T.C.   v.   S. Satalingappa7   and  Oriental Fire and General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Suman Navnath Rajguru8 were pressed into service. The Court, after referring to the decisions cited by the respondent and the analysis made by the High Court, opined:Â­ â26.  â¦In our  opinion, the word âuseâ has a wider connotation to cover the period when the vehicle is not   moving   and   is   stationary   and   the   use   of   a vehicle   does   not   cease   on   account   of   the   vehicle 4 [1960] 1 QB 367 : [1959] 3 All ER 733 5 (1965) 114 CLR 437 6 1975 ACJ 396 (Del HC) 7 1979 ACJ 452 (Kant HC) 8 1985 ACJ 243 (Bom HC) having   been   rendered   immobile   on   account   of   a breakdown or mechanical defect or accident. In the circumstances,   it   cannot   be   said   that   the   petrol tanker was not in the use at the time when it was lying on its side after the collision with the truck.â

14. After so holding, the Court proceeded to consider whether explosion   and   fire   which   caused   injuries   to   the   insured   and eventual death of one could be said to have taken place due to an accident arising out of the use of the motor vehicle, i.e., the petrol tanker.   In   that   context,   the   question   of   causal   relationship between the user of the motor vehicle and the accident which has resulted in death or disablement arose.  Be it stated, the stand of the   petitioner   that   the   deceased   and   the   injured   persons   were engaged in pilferage of petrol and the explosion of fire took place because  of  the  unlawful  activities was negatived as the finding recorded by the tribunal on the said score had been overturned by the learned Single Judge whose view had been approved by the appellate Bench of the High Court.

15. The Court referred to Heyman v. Darwins Ltd.9, Union of India v. E.B. Aabyâs Rederi A/S10  and  Samick Lines Co. Ltd. v. Owners of the Antonis P. Lemos 11 and thereafter adverted to 9  [1942] AC 356 : [1942] 1 All ER 337 10 [1975] AC 797 : [1974] 2 All ER 874 11 [1985] 2 WLR 468 the decision of the High Court of Australia in  R.J. Green Case wherein Lord Barwick, C.J. has stated:Â­ âBearing in mind the general purpose of the Act I think the expression âarising out ofâ must be taken to   require   a   less   proximate   relationship   of   the injury   to   the   relevant   use   of   the   vehicle   than   is required to satisfy the words âcaused byâ. It may be that an association of the injury with the use of the vehicle   while   it  cannot  be said that that use was causally related to the injury may yet be enough to satisfy the expression âarise out ofâ as used in the Act and in the policy.â   The observation of Windeyer, J. that was reproduced by the Court is to the following effect:Â­ âThe words âinjury caused by or arising out of the use   of   the   vehicleâ   postulate   a   causal   relationship between   the   use   of   the   vehicle   and   the   injury. âCaused   byâ   connotes   a   âdirectâ   or   âproximateâ relationship   of   cause   and   effect.   âArising   out   ofâ extends this to a result that is less immediate; but it still carries a sense of consequence.â

16. The twoÂ­Judge Bench, appreciating the wider connotation, proceeded to lay down:Â­ â36.  This   would   show   that   as   compared   to   the expression âcaused byâ, the expression âarising out ofâ has a wider connotation. The expression âcaused byâ was used in Sections 95(1)(b)(i) and (ii) and 96(2)

(b)(ii)   of   the   Act.   In   Section   92Â­A,   Parliament, however,   chose   to   use   the   expression   âarising   out ofâ which indicates that for the purpose of awarding compensation   under   Section   92Â­A,   the   causal relationship   between   the   use   of   the   motor   vehicle and   the   accident   resulting   in   death   or   permanent disablement   is   not   required   to   be   direct   and proximate and it can be less immediate. This would imply   that   accident   should   be   connected   with   the use   of   the   motor   vehicle   but   the   said   connection need not be direct and immediate. This construction of the expression âarising out of the use of a motor vehicleâ   in   Section   92Â­A   enlarges   the   field   of protection   made   available   to   the   victims   of   an accident   and   is   in   consonance   with   the   beneficial object underlying the enactment.â

17. Thereafter, the Division Bench posed the question, whether the accident involving explosion and fire in the petrol tanker was connected with the use of tanker as a motor vehicle.  Concurring with the view of the High Court, it ruled:Â­ â37. â¦In our view, in the facts and circumstances of the present case, this question must be answered in the affirmative. The High Court has found that the tanker   in   question   was   carrying   petrol   which   is   a highly   combustible   and   volatile   material   and   after the collision with the other motor vehicle the tanker had fallen on one of its sides on the sloping ground resulting in escape of highly inflammable petrol and that there was grave risk of explosion and fire from the petrol coming out of the tanker.  In the light of the  aforesaid circumstances the learned Judges of the   High   Court   have   rightly   concluded   that   the collision between the tanker  and the other vehicle which had occurred earlier and the escape of petrol from   the   tanker   which   ultimately   resulted   in   the explosion and fire were not unconnected but related events   and   merely   because   there   was   interval   of about four to four and half hours between the said collision and the explosion and fire in the tanker, it cannot   be   necessarily   inferred   that   there   was   no causal   relation   between   explosion   and   fire.  In   the circumstances,   it   must  be  held  that   the  explosion and   fire   resulting   in   the   injuries   which   led  to   the death of Deepak Uttam More was due to an accident arising out of the use of the motor vehicle viz. the petrol tanker No. MKL 7461.â [Emphasis supplied] The aforesaid analysis throws immense light to understand the concept of ârelated eventsâ and âcausal relationâ. They have been   distinguished   from   an   event   which   is   not   connected. Needless to say, the appreciation of causal relation is a question of fact in each case and is to be weighed and appreciated on the basis of the materials brought on record. 

18. In Union of India v. United India Insurance Co. Ltd. and others12, a twoÂ­Judge Bench has opined that the words âuse of the   motor   vehicleâ   is   to  be  construed in  a wider  manner.   The learned Judges referred to the decision in  Patilâs  case wherein reference was made to the Australian case in R.J. Green (supra) and to the observations of Lord Barwick, C.J. that those words have   to   be   widely   construed.   The   Court,   in   the   latter   case, referred to the observations of Windeyer, J. in R.J. Greenâs case which read thus:Â­   ââ¦ no sound reason was given for restricting the phrase, âthe use of a motor vehicleâ in this way. The 12 (1997) 8 SCC 683 only limitation upon it â¦ that I can see is that the injury must be one  in any way a consequence of a use of the vehicles as a motor vehicle.â The   aforesaid   passage   emphasizes   on   âconsequence   of   a useâ. It is equated with a ârelated eventâ. 

19. The aforesaid view has been reiterated in Samir Chanda v. Managing Director, Assam State Transport Corporation13.  In the   said   case,   a   bomb   exploded   inside   the   bus   as   a   result   of which the appellant sustained serious injuries on his legs.   The tribunal passed an award in favour of the claimant.   In appeal preferred by the respondent, the High Court, while not disturbing the finding of the tribunal on facts, expressed the view that there was no negligence on the part of the owner or the driver of the vehicle and, therefore, the question of paying compensation did not arise.  This Court referred to Patilâs case and placing reliance on the same, opined:Â­ â14. â¦ The explosion took place inside the bus is an admitted  fact  and  the usual police escort was not there. The High Court, except observing that there was no negligence, has not upset the finding of the Tribunal that the atmosphere during the period of accident was so polluted requiring care on the part of   the   conductor   and the  driver  of  the bus. There cannot be any doubt that the accident arose out of 13 (1998) 6 SCC 605 the use of the motor vehicle justifying the claim of the appellant.â 

20.   The decision in  United India Insurance Co. Ltd.  (supra) has ruled that if it is ultimately found that there is no negligence on the part of the driver of the vehicle or there is no defect in the vehicle but the accident is only due to the sole negligence of the other parties/agencies, then on that finding, the claim would go out   of   Section   110(1)   of   the   1939   Act   because   the   case   would then become one of exclusive negligence of the Railways. Again if the   accident   had   arisen   only   on   account   of   the   negligence   of persons   other   than   the   driver/owner   of   the   motor   vehicle,   the claim would not be maintainable before the tribunal.",lb

1. These appeals arise from the judgment dated 6 th September, 2010 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh in Writ Petition No. 10963 of 2009 and 12485 of 2009 setting aside the award passed by the Central Government Signature Not Verified Digitally signed by SATISH KUMAR YADAV Date: 2019.07.05 16:50:05 IST Reason:

Industrial Tribunal(CGIT), Jabalpur dated 16th September, 2009 answering the reference in the affirmative form and directing the contract labourers who were in the employment of SAIL from 1993 till 1996(17th March, 1993 to April 1996) to be reinstated, and their cases be considered for regularisation in accordance with Para 125 of the Judgment of this Court in Steel Authority of India Ltd. and Others Vs. National Union Waterfront Workers and Others1 declining to grant them back wages.

2. The case involves a chequered history and almost after four rounds of litigation, the matter has reached at a stage where the reference was made by the appropriate Government under Section 10(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 to decide the industrial dispute raised by the Union, namely, Ispat Khadan Janta Mazdoor Union vide notification dated 27th January, 2003 followed with 22nd February, 2005.

3. The seminal facts in brief which may be relevant for the present purpose are that the appellant Steel Authority of India Limited (hereinafter being referred to as âSAILâ) is a Government of India undertaking and is a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India and has steel plants in different 1 2001(7) SCC 1 parts of India. SAIL has one of the captive lime stone and dolomite mines in Kuteshwar in the District of Katni of Madhya Pradesh. Limestone and Dolomite are necessary ingredients for manufacture of steel. The SAIL did blasting work as this work had been departmentalised vide Notification dated 15 th December, 1979 w.e.f. 22nd June, 1980. The contract labour of the contractors at Kuteshwar Lime Stone Mines were doing the same jobs as enumerated in schedule of the prohibition Notification No. S.O. 707 dated 17th March, 1993 issued under Section 10(1) of the Contract Labour(Regulation & Abolition) Act, 1970(hereinafter referred to as âCLRA Actâ).

4. It is not disputed that the establishment of the appellant(SAIL) is the registered establishment in terms of Section 7 of the CLRA Act and the contractors through whom the contract labour was engaged were also holding a valid licence under Section 12 of the CLRA Act and the workmen engaged as contract labour by the contractor in the establishment of the appellant(SAIL) were paid their due wages in terms of the triÂ­ partite agreement entered into from time to time not less than the rates so prescribed by the authority under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948.

5. The appropriate Government at a later stage issued a prohibition notification of employment of contract labour for the establishment wherein their services hired by the appellant SAIL under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act dated 17 th March, 1993, the extract of which is referred to hereunder:Â­ â4. The Notification No.S.O.707 dated 17Â­3Â­93 was issued and published by the Government of India whereby prohibited with effect from the date of publication of this notification, the employment of Contract Labour in the works specified in the following schedule in the Lime Stone and Dolomite Mines in the country namely:

SCHEDULE a. Raising of minerals including breaking sizing sorting of Lime Stone Dolomite and, b. Transportation of limestone and dolomite which includes loading and unloading from trucks, dumpers, conveyors and transportation from mine site to factory.â
6. Pursuant to a prohibition notification issued by the appropriate Government under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act, the relationship of contractor and contract labour stands ceased and by legal fiction, contract comes to extinct and the indisputed fact which has come on record is that no fresh agreement, in the interregnum period, was executed and the existing agreement to whom the appellant & contract labour is a signatory was extended from time to time by the competent authority and the contract labour was allowed to continue on the same terms and conditions till their services were terminated by the contractor in the month of April, 1996.

7. Prior to the judgment of the Constitution Bench of this Court[Steel Authority of India Ltd. and Others(supra)], the three Judge Bench of this Court in Air India Statutory Corporation and Others Vs. United Labour Union and Others2 discussed the legal consequence of the prohibition notification under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act prohibiting employment of contract labour, it was held that on abolition of contract labour system from any establishment under Section 10 of the Act by the appropriate Government, the logical and legitimate consequences were that the erstwhile regulated contract labourer covered by the sweep of such abolition for the activities concerned would be entitled to be treated as direct 2 1997(9) SCC 377 employee of the employer on whose establishment they were earlier working and they would be entitled to be treated as regular employees from the day on which the contract labour system in the establishment for the work which they were doing gets abolished.

8. The effect of the prohibition notification under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act issued by the appropriate Government at the later stage, came to be examined by the Constitution Bench of this Court in Steel Authority of India Ltd. and Others (supra) wherein it was held that there is no provision under CLRA Act whether expressly or necessary implication which provides for automatic absorption of contract labour on issuance of a notification by the appropriate Government under Section 10(1), prohibiting employment of contract labour in any process, operation or other work in any other establishment and overruled the judgment in Air India Statutory Corporation and Others (supra) making it clear that neither Section 10 nor any other provision in the CLRA Act provides for automatic absorption of contact labour on issuance of a notification by the appropriate Government under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act and consequently the principal employer is not required by operation of law to absorb the contract labour working in the establishment. The exposition of law will be discussed at the later stage.

9. It reveals from the record that after the Constitution Bench Judgment of this Court, the matter was agitated by the workers union before the appropriate Government and after failure of the conciliation proceedings, the case of 3404 workmen was referred for adjudication by the appropriate Government vide its notification dated 27th January, 2003 followed with 22nd February, 2005 to the Central Government Industrial Tribunal(CGIT) is reproduced hereunder:Â­

1. âThe Government of India, Ministry of Labour vide its Notification No.LÂ­29011/97/2002Â­IR(M) dated 27Â­1Â­ 2003 has referred the following dispute for adjudication by this tribunal:Â­ âI. âWhether the action of the Mines Manager, Koteshwar Lime Stone Mines of Steel Authority of India Ltd. in terminating services of 3404 (3380+24Â­ as per list attached) mine workers in April 1996 who ceased to be contract labour after prohibition of employment of contract labour in Lime Stone Mine vide Notification No.S.O.707 dated 17Â­3Â­93 was legal, fair and justified? If not, what relief the concerned workmen or heirs in case of deceased worker are entitled to?

 II. Whether the action of the Mines manager, Koteshwar Lime Stone Mines of Steel Authority of India ltd. in denying terminal benefits of gratuity retrenchment compensation and exgratia applicable to VRS seeking employees is fair and justified. If not, to what relief these workers/heirs are entitled to? III. Whether the action of the management of the Mines Manager, Koteshwar Lime Stone Mines of Steel Authority of India Ltd. in disregarding ClauseÂ­8 of Memorandum of Agreement signed between the Steel Authority of India, New Delhi and their Unions including HMS and employing workers through contractors on jobs of permanent and perennial nature in Mines between 5Â­20 years even without ensuring statutory wages and service conditions was legal, fair and justified? If not, to what relief concerned workmen/heirs are entitled?â CORRIGENDUM âWhether the employment of the workmen mentioned in this Ministryâs order of even number dated 27Â­1Â­2003 through contractors is sham and bogus and whether in effect there is direct employment by the company? If so, to what relief the workmen concerned are entitled?â

10. The learned Tribunal(CGIT), as a fact finding authority, taking note of the pleadings on record framed the following issues:Â­ âI. Whether the reference R/40/03 is maintainable? II. Whether the employment of the workmen through contractors is sham and bogus and whether the said employment is considered to be direct employment by the management?

 III.Whether the action of the Mines Manager, Kuteshwar Lime Stone Mines of the Steel Authority of India Ltd. in terminating the services of 3404(3380+24) as per list attached mine workers in April 1996 who ceased to be contract labour after prohibition of employment of contract labour in lime stone vide Notification No.S.O.707 dated 17Â­03Â­93 was legal, fair and justified?

IV.Whether the said contact workers/heirs are entitled the terminal Benefits of gratuity, retrenchment compensation and exÂ­gratia applicable to VRS from SAIL?

V. Whether Lime Stone Mines violated the provision of ClauseÂ­8 of the memorandum of agreement signed between the SAIL, New Delhi and their Unions and employing workers through contractors on jobs of permanent and perennial nature was justified, legal and fair?

VI.Whether the workmen/heirs are entitled to the wages to the post in which they were engaged with parity of wages with that of regular employees of the management with all consequential benefits? VII.Any other relief, the workmen/heirs are entitled to?â

11. The parties to the reference were called upon to lay evidence in support of their respective claim and after taking note of the evidence(oral & documentary), the Tribunal recorded the facts in seriatim emerging from the records as under:Â­ (1) The evidence shows that the respective contractors employed the contract labours for their own and they were the appointing authority.

 (2) Wage slips, wagesheets and the evidence of the witnesses clearly show that the contractors were paying wages to the contract labours.

(3) Exhibit M/8 filed in R721/05 and the evidence of the witnesses show that the contractor dismissed the employee and also transferred some of the employees from the place of work and had disciplinary authority. (4) The contract papers entered into between the management and the contractors and the evidence of the witnesses clearly show that contractors had full control and supervision over the work. The management had only to see that the labour laws were being implemented and specified approved grade of lime stone was being supplied.

(5) The contract papers and the evidence show that the contractors had full control over the skilled and professional work.

(6) It is further clear from the contract papers that the SAIL had right to reject the limestone, if it was not within the specified approved grade as per terms and conditions of the agreement.

(7) The contract agreements further show that there was penal clause, if there was any breach of contract.

12. The Tribunal taking note of the evidence including oral and documentary adduced in support of the reference held that the contract between the Management(SAIL) and the contractors was genuine and not sham and bogus and the contract workers were allowed to continue even after the prohibition notification under Section 10(1) dated 17th March, 1993 under the CLRA Act on the same terms and conditions and the services of the contract labourer were terminated by the Contractor in April, 1996.

13. It may be noted that status of the workers after the issuance of notification dated 17th March, 1993 has also been examined by the Tribunal and held as follows:Â­ (1) The contract labours after notification cease to function.

(2) The contract labours were still working in the establishment from 1993 to April 1996 under the umbrella of the contractors who may be called as agent of the Principal employer or were intermediary between the contract labours and the Principal Employer after the publication of notification.

(3) The contract between the Principal Employer and the contractors after publication of the notification ceases to exist and became not genuine.

(4) The wages were being paid to the contract labour by the so called contractors in the same way as from before.

(5) The principal Employer was in need of the workers for the specified works even after the publication of the notification as same workers were continuing in work till April, 1996.

(6) There is no evidence on the record to show that the principal employer adopted the procedure of regularization and had intended to employ regular workers as has been directed by the Honâble Apex Court at Para 125 subÂ­paraÂ­6 in the Constitution Bench Judgment in the case of SAIL versus National Union Water Front Workers (Supra) after the contract was found genuine before the notification.  (7) There was no automatic absorption of contract labour on issuing the notification prohibiting the employment of contract labours.

(8) Contract labours were found employees of the respective contractors before notification.

14. At the same time, in para 85 of the Award, the Tribunal further held that after issuance of the prohibition notification dated 17th March, 1993 in the instant case, the principal employer(SAIL) was prohibited to employ any contract labour in any process, operation or other work in the establishment and when the contract with the contractors after prohibition notification became void and not genuine and the extension of the period of contract of the respective contractors which has been allowed to continue in the establishment by operation of law became abÂ­initio void and sham and bogus. Para 85 of the Award is as under:Â­ â85. It is an established fact that the notification dated 7Â­3Â­93 came to the effect prohibiting the employment of contract labours from the date of its publication. As such, in the light of the constitutional bench judgment in SAIL versus National Water Front Workers Union & others (Supra) the contract of Principal employer with contractor in regard to the contract labour comes to an end beyond shadow of doubts and the contract with regard to the contract labours subsequently after the notification dated 17Â­3Â­  1993 becomes not genuine. The Principal employer was prohibited to employ any contract labour in any process, operation or other work in the establishment in any process, operation or other work in the establishment to which the notification relates at any time thereafter. It is evident that when the contract of the contractors after notification became itself void and not genuine, the extension of the period of contract of the respective contractors would be abÂ­initio void and sham and bogus. Thus it is established that the contract of Principal employer with contractors in regard to the contract labours became subsequently sham and bogus after the notification No. S.O. 707 dated 17Â­3Â­1993 coming into the effect from the date of its publication.â

15. The Tribunal finally held that the employment of the contract labourer through contractors was not sham and bogus before notification dated 17th March, 1993, but after publication of the said notification, by operation of law, the contract through contractors could not be considered to be genuine but became void and sham as the contract labour was allowed to continue in the establishment till April 1996. It was further observed that the Union is at liberty to take recourse of the penal consequences as mandated under Section 23 to 25 of the CLRA Act. Rest of the issues framed by the Tribunal(Issue nos. 3,4, 5 & 6) have been consequently decided accordingly under the Industrial Award dated 16th September, 2009.",lb
"Deepak Gupta, J.

1. Kajal was a bright young girl. She used to attend school, play with her friends and lead a normal life like any other child. Unfortunately, on 18th October, 2007, while Kajal was travelling on a tractor with her parents, the tractor was hit by a truck which was driven rashly. In the said accident, Kajal suffered serious injuries resulting in damage to her brain. This has had Signature Not Verified very serious consequences on her. She was examined at the Post Digitally signed by CHARANJEET KAUR Date: 2020.02.05 16:55:13 IST Reason:

Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh (PGI, Chandigarh for short), for assessment of her disability. According to the said report, because of head injury Kajal is left with a very low I.Q. and severe weakness in all her four limbs, suffers from severe hysteria and severe urinary incontinence. Her disability has been assessed as 100%.

2. Dr. Chhabra (PWÂ­4), who was one of the members of the Board which issued the disability certificate (Ex.P6) stated that as per the assessment her I.Q. is less than 20% of a child of her age and her social age is only of a 9 month old child. This means that Kajal while lying on the bed will grow up to be an adult with all the physical and biological attributes which a woman would get on attaining adulthood, including menstruation etc., but her mind will remain of a 9 month old child. Basically, she will not understand what is happening all around her.

3. How does one assess compensation in such a case? No amount of money can compensate this child for the injuries suffered by her. She can never be put back in the same position. However, compensation has to be determined in terms of the provisions of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (for short the Act). The Act requires determination of payment of just compensation and it is the duty of the court to ensure that she is paid compensation which is just.

4. Kajal through her father filed a claim petition, under the Act. The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT for short) awarded Rs.11,08,501/Â­ and held that since there was violation of the terms of policy the insurance company would pay the amount but would be entitled to recover the same from the owner. The High Court enhanced the award amount to Rs.25,78,501/Â­ under the following heads:

Transportation details / special diet Rs. 50,000/Â­ Total Rs.25,78,501/Â­ Aggrieved by the award the claimant is before this Court.

5. The principles with regard to determination of just compensation contemplated under the Act are well settled. Injuries cause deprivation to the body which entitles the claimant to claim damages. The damages may vary according to the gravity of the injuries sustained by the claimant in an accident. On account of the injuries, the claimant may suffer consequential losses such as (i) loss of earning; (ii) expenses on treatment which may include medical expenses, transportation, special diet, attendant charges etc., (iii) loss or diminution to the pleasures of life by loss of a particular part of the body, and (iv) loss of future earning capacity. Damages can be pecuniary as well as nonÂ­ pecuniary, but all have to be assessed in Rupees and Paise.

6. It is impossible to equate human suffering and personal deprivation with money. However, this is what the Act enjoins upon the courts to do. The court has to make a judicious attempt to award damages, so as to compensate the claimant for the loss suffered by the victim. On the one hand, the compensation should not be assessed very conservatively, but on the other hand, compensation should also not be assessed in so liberal a fashion so as to make it a bounty to the claimant. The court while assessing the compensation should have regard to the degree of deprivation and the loss caused by such deprivation. Such compensation is what is termed as just compensation. The compensation or damages assessed for personal injuries should be substantial to compensate the injured for the deprivation suffered by the injured throughout his/her life. They should not be just token damages.

7. There are numerous cases where the principles for grant of compensation have been enunciated. It would be relevant to quote pertinent observations from a few.

8. In Phillips v. Western Railway Co.1, Field, J., while emphasizing that damages must be full and adequate, held thus:

""You cannot put the plaintiff back again into his original position, but you must bring your reasonable common sense to bear, and you must always recollect that this is the only occasion on which compensation can be given. The plaintiff can never sue again for it. You have, therefore, now to give him compensation once and for all. He has done no wrong, he has suffered a wrong at the hands of the defendants and you must take care to give him full fair compensation for that which he has suffered."" Besides, the Tribunals should always remember that the measures of damages in all these cases ""should be such as to enable even a tortfeasor to say that he had amply atoned for his misadventure"".
9. In the case of Mediana2, Lord Halsbury held:

""Of course the whole region of inquiry into damages is one of extreme difficulty. You very often cannot even lay down any principle upon which you can give damages;
nevertheless, it is remitted to the jury, or those who stand in place of the jury, to consider what compensation in money shall be given for what is a wrongful act. Take the most familiar and ordinary case: how is anybody to measure pain and suffering in moneys counted? Nobody 1 (1874) 4 QBD 406 2 [1900] AC 113  can suggest that you can by any arithmetical calculation establish what is the exact amount of money which would represent such a thing as the pain and suffering which a person has undergone by reason of an accident. In truth, I think it would be very arguable to say that a person would be entitled to no damages for such thing. What manly mind cares about pain and suffering that is past? But, nevertheless, the law recognizes that as a topic upon which damages may be given.""

10. The following observations of Lord Morris in his speech in H. West & Son Ltd. v. Shephard3, are very pertinent:

""Money may be awarded so that something tangible may be procured to replace something else of the like nature which has been destroyed or lost. But money cannot renew a physical frame that has been battered and shattered. All that Judges and courts can do is to award sums which must be regarded as giving reasonable compensation. In the process there must be the endeavour to secure some uniformity in the general method of approach. By common assent awards must be reasonable and must be assessed with moderation. Furthermore, it is eminently desirable that so far as possible comparable injuries should be compensated by comparable awards.""
In the same case Lord Devlin observed that the proper approach to the problem was to adopt a test as to what contemporary society would deem to be a fair sum, such as would allow the wrongdoer to ""hold up his head among his neighbours and say with their approval that he has done the fair thing"", which should be kept in mind by the court in determining compensation in personal injury cases.

3 1963 2 WLR 1359
11. Lord Denning while speaking for the Court of Appeal in the case of Ward v. James4, laid down the following three basic principles to be followed in such like cases:

""Firstly, accessibility: In cases of grave injury, where the body is wrecked or brain destroyed, it is very difficult to assess a fair compensation in money, so difficult that the award must basically be a conventional figure, derived from experience or from awards in comparable cases. Secondly, uniformity: There should be some measure of uniformity in awards so that similar decisions may be given in similar cases; otherwise there will be great dissatisfaction in the community and much criticism of the administration of justice. Thirdly, predictability: Parties should be able to predict with some measure of accuracy the sum which is likely to be awarded in a particular case, for by this means cases can be settled peaceably and not brought to court, a thing very much to the public good.""
12. The assessment of damages in personal injury cases raises great difficulties. It is not easy to convert the physical and mental loss into monetary terms. There has to be a measure of calculated guess work and conjecture. An assessment, as best as can, in the circumstances, should be made.

13. In McGregorâs Treatise on Damages, 14th Edn., para 1157, referring to heads of damages in personal injury actions states:

""The person physically injured may recover both for his pecuniary losses and his nonÂ­pecuniary losses. Of these the pecuniary losses themselves comprise two separate items, viz., the loss of earnings and other gains which the plaintiff would have made had he not been injured and the medical and other expenses to which he is put as a 4 (1965) 1 All ER 563  result of the injury, and the courts have subÂ­divided the nonÂ­pecuniary losses into three categories, viz., pain and suffering, loss of amenities of life and loss of expectation of life.""
14. In M/s Concord of India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Nirmala Devi and others5, this Court held:

""2â¦.The determination of the quantum must be liberal, not niggardly since the law values life and limb in a free country in generous scales.""
15. In R.D. Hattangadi v. Pest Control (India) Pvt. Ltd.6, dealing with the different heads of compensation in injury cases this Court held thus:

""9. Broadly speaking, while fixing the amount of compensation payable to a victim of an accident, the damages have to be assessed separately as pecuniary damages and special damages. Pecuniary damages are those which the victim has actually incurred and which are capable of being calculated in terms of money; whereas nonÂ­pecuniary damages are those which are incapable of being assessed by arithmetical calculations. In order to appreciate two concepts pecuniary damages may include expenses incurred by the claimant: (i) medical attendance; (ii) loss of earning of profit up to the date of trial; (iii) other material loss. So far as nonÂ­ pecuniary damages are concerned, they may include:
(i) damages for mental and physical shock, pain and suffering already suffered or likely to be suffered in the future; (ii) damages to compensate for the loss of amenities of life which may include a variety of matters, i.e., on account of injury the claimant may not be able to walk, run or sit; (iii) damages for loss of expectation of life, i.e. on account of injury the normal longevity of the person concerned is shortened; (iv) inconvenience, hardship, 5 1980 ACJ 55 (SC) 6 (1995) 1 SCC 551  discomfort, disappointment, frustration and mental stress in life.""
16. In Raj Kumar v. Ajay Kumar and Others7, this Court laid down the heads under which compensation is to be awarded for personal injuries.
""6. The heads under which compensation is awarded in personal injury cases are the following:
Pecuniary damages (Special damages)
(i)Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and miscellaneous expenditure.
(ii) Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made had he not been injured, comprising:
(a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment;
(b) Loss of future earnings on account of permanent disability.
(iii) Future medical expenses.
NonÂ­pecuniary damages (General damages)
(iv) Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the injuries.
(v) Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage).
(vi) Loss of expectation of life (shortening of normal longevity).
In routine personal injury cases, compensation will be awarded only under heads (i), (ii) (a) and (iv). It is only in serious cases of injury, where there is specific medical evidence corroborating the evidence of the claimant, that compensation will be granted under any of the heads (ii)(b), (iii), (v) and (vi) relating to loss of future earnings on account of permanent disability, future medical expenses, loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage) and loss of expectation of life.â 7 (2011) 1 SCC 343
17. In K. Suresh v. New India Assurance Company Ltd. and Ors.8, this Court held as follows :

â2...There cannot be actual compensation for anguish of the heart or for mental tribulations. The quintessentiality lies in the pragmatic computation of the loss sustained which has to be in the realm of realistic approximation. Therefore, Section 168 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (for brevity âthe Actâ) stipulates that there should be grant of âjust compensationâ. Thus, it becomes a challenge for a court of law to determine âjust compensationâ which is neither a bonanza nor a windfall, and simultaneously, should not be a pittance.â
18. Applying the aforesaid principles, we now proceed to assess the compensation.

Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization, medicines, transportation etc.

19. The High Court under the two heads of medical treatment and transport has awarded Rs.1,88,501/Â­. Out of this an amount of Rs.1,38,501/Â­ is the actual expense incurred on the treatment of Kajal. One must remember that amongst people who are not Government employees and belong to the poorer strata of society, bills are not retained. Some of the bills have been excluded by the courts below only on the ground that the name of the patient is not written on the bill. There is no dispute with regard to the long period of treatment and 8 (2012) 12 SCC 274 hospitalisation of this young girl. Immediately after the accident on 18.10.2007, she was admitted at a hospital in Karnal. From there, she was referred to the PGI, Chandigarh, where she remained admitted from 21.10.2007 till 12.11.2007 and, thereafter, she was again admitted in the hospital from 12.11.2007 till 08.12.2007. She was in the hospital for almost 51 days, and both Dr. Sameer Aggarwal (PWÂ­3) from the hospital at Karnal and Dr. Rajesh Chhabra (PWÂ­4), from PGI, Chandigarh, have supported this. Limiting the amount only to the bills which have been paid in the name of the claimant only, would not be reasonable. Therefore, the amount payable for actual medical expenses is increased from Rs.1,38,501/Â­ to Rs.2,00,000/Â­. The amount awarded for transportation at Rs.50,000/Â­ is reasonable. Therefore, under this head we award Rs.2,50,000/Â­.

Loss of earnings

20. Both the courts below have held that since the girl was a young child of 12 years only notional income of Rs.15,000/Â­ per annum can be taken into consideration. We do not think this is a proper way of assessing the future loss of income. This young girl after studying could have worked and would have earned much more than Rs.15,000/Â­ per annum. Each case has to be decided on its own evidence but taking notional income to be Rs.15,000/Â­ per annum is not at all justified. The appellant has placed before us material to show that the minimum wages payable to a skilled workman is Rs.4846/Â­ per month. In our opinion this would be the minimum amount which she would have earned on becoming a major. Adding 40% for the future prospects, it works to be Rs.6784.40/Â­ per month, i.e., 81,412.80 per annum. Applying the multiplier of 18 it works out to Rs.14,65,430.40, which is rounded off to Rs.14,66,000/Â­

21. Though the claimant would have been entitled to separate attendant charges for the period during which she was hospitalised, we are refraining from awarding the same because we are going to award her attendant charges for life. At the same time, we are clearly of the view that the tortfeasor cannot take benefit of the gratuitous service rendered by the family members. When this small girl was taken to PGI, Chandigarh, or was in her village, 2Â­3 family members must have accompanied her. Even if we are not paying them the attendant charges they must be paid for loss of their wages and the amount they would have spent in hospital for food etc. These family members left their work in the village to attend to this little girl in the hospital at Karnal or Chandigarh. In the hospital the claimant would have had at least two attendants, and taking the cost of each at Rs.500/Â­ per day for 51 days, we award her Rs.51,000/Â­.

Attendant charges

22. The attendant charges have been awarded by the High Court @ Rs.2,500/Â­ per month for 44 years, which works out to Rs.13,20,000/Â­. Unfortunately, this system is not a proper system. Multiplier system is used to balance out various factors. When compensation is awarded in lump sum, various factors are taken into consideration. When compensation is paid in lump sum, this Court has always followed the multiplier system. The multiplier system should be followed not only for determining the compensation on account of loss of income but also for determining the attendant charges etc. This system was recognised by this Court in Gobald Motor Service Ltd. v. R.M.K. Veluswami9. The multiplier system factors in the inflation rate, the rate of interest payable on the lump sum 9 AIR 1962 SC 1 award, the longevity of the claimant, and also other issues such as the uncertainties of life. Out of all the various alternative methods, the multiplier method has been recognised as the most realistic and reasonable method. It ensures better justice between the parties and thus results in award of âjust compensationâ within the meaning of the Act.

23. It would be apposite at this stage to refer to the observation of Lord Reid in Taylor v. OâConnor10:

""Damages to make good the loss of dependency over a period of years must be awarded as a lump sum and that sum is generally calculated by applying a multiplier to the amount of one year's dependency. That is a perfectly good method in the ordinary case but it conceals the fact that there are two quite separate matters involved, the present value of the series of future payments, and the discounting of that present value to allow for the fact that for one reason or another the person receiving the damages might never have enjoyed the whole of the benefit of the dependency. It is quite unnecessary in the ordinary case to deal with these matters separately. Judges and counsel have a wealth of experience which is an adequate guide to the selection of the multiplier and any expert evidence is rightly discouraged. But in a case where the facts are special, I think, that these matters must have separate consideration if even rough justice is to be done and expert evidence may be valuable or even almost essential. The special factor in the present case is the incidence of Income Tax and, it may be, surtax.""
24. This Court has reaffirmed the multiplier method in various cases like Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Subhagwati 10 1971 AC 115 and Ors.11, U.P. State Road Transport Corporation and Ors. v. Trilok Chandra and Ors.12, Sandeep Khanduja v. Atul Dande and Ors.13. This Court has also recognised that Schedule II of the Act can be used as a guide for the multiplier to be applied in each case. Keeping the claimantâs age in mind, the multiplier in this case should be 18 as opposed to 44 taken by the High Court.

25. Having held so, we are clearly of the view that the basic amount taken for determining attendant charges is very much on the lower side. We must remember that this little girl is severely suffering from incontinence meaning that she does not have control over her bodily functions like passing urine and faeces. As she grows older, she will not be able to handle her periods. She requires an attendant virtually 24 hours a day. She requires an attendant who though may not be medically trained but must be capable of handling a child who is bed ridden. She would require an attendant who would ensure that she does not suffer from bed sores. The claimant has placed before us a notification of the State of Haryana of the year 2010, 11 1966 ACJ 57 12 (1996) 4 SCC 362 13 (2017) 3 SCC 351 wherein the wages for skilled labourer is Rs.4846/Â­ per month. We, therefore, assess the cost of one attendant at Rs.5,000/Â­ and she will require two attendants which works out to Rs.10,000/Â­ per month, which comes to Rs.1,20,000/Â­ per annum, and using the multiplier of 18 it works out to Rs.21,60,000/Â­ for attendant charges for her entire life. This takes care of all the pecuniary damages.

Pain, Suffering and Loss of Amenities

26. Coming to the nonÂ­pecuniary damages under the head of pain, suffering, loss of amenities, the High Court has awarded this girl only Rs.3,00,000/Â­. In Mallikarjun v. Divisional Manager, The National Insurance Company Limited and Ors.14, this Court while dealing with the issue of award under this head held that it should be at least Rs.6,00,000/Â­, if the disability is more than 90%. As far as the present case is concerned, in addition to the 100% physical disability the young girl is suffering from severe incontinence, she is suffering from severe hysteria and above all she is left with a brain of a nine month old child. This is a case where departure has to be made 14 2013 (10) SCALE 668 from the normal rule and the pain and suffering suffered by this child is such that no amount of compensation can compensate.",lb
"A.K. SIKRI, J.

Writ Petition (Civil) No. 728 of 2015 was filed on September Signature Not Verified 24, 2015 on behalf of three infants, who are made petitioners in Digitally signed by SUSHIL KUMAR RAKHEJA Date: 2018.10.23 12:24:11 IST Reason:

this writ petition. Petitioner No.1 and 2, on the date of filing of this  writ petition, were six months old and petitioner No.3 was fourteen months old. This petition has been filed through their next friends, i.e. their fathers, who are concerned about the health of their children as they feel that due to the alarming degradation of the air quality, leading to severe air pollution in the city of Delhi (where these petitioners reside), the petitioners may encounter various health hazards. Poor, very poor or severe air quality/air pollution affects all citizens, irrespective of their age. However, claim the petitioners, children are much more vulnerable to air pollutants as exposure thereto may affect them in various ways, including aggravation of asthma, coughing, bronchitis, retarded nervous system breakdown and even cognitive impairment. The petition accepts that there are number of reasons which have contributed to poor air quality in Delhi and National Capital Region (for short, âNCRâ). At the same time, it is emphasised that air pollution hits its nadir during Diwali time because of indiscriminate use of firecrackers, the chemical composition whereof increases harmful particulate matters such as PM 2.5 or PM10 at alarming level thereby bringing the situation of âemergencyâ. The petitioners have, thus, prayed for direction to the official respondents to take possible measures for checking the pollution by stricking at the causes of the pollution, which  includes seasonal crop burning, indiscriminate dumping of dust/malba and other pollutants, etc. The prayer also includes banning the use, in any form, of firecrackers, sparkles and minor explosives, in any form, during festivals or otherwise.

2) This petition came up for preliminary hearing on October 08, 2015 when notice was issued and the matter was directed to be listed on October 16, 2015 at 2:00 p.m. since the petitioners wanted stay on burning of crackers during Diwali, which was around the corner in that year. When the matter was taken up on October 16, 2015, certain suggestions were made by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners, which were as under:

â1. Restrict licenses to low hazard fireworks.
2. Period of grant of license is too early â need not be from 2 days prior to Dussehra.
3. Restrict window for use of fireworks to be from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.
4. RWAs to hold community fireworks for a brief period of 30 minutes on a single day.
5. Government be directed to give wide publicity to the ill effects of fireworks and encourage restraint on responsible use.
6. Encourage teachers to tell students not to buy and use fireworks.â

3) Suggestion Nos. 5 and 6 were accepted and the relevant portion of the order that was passed reads as under:

 âIn our view for the present, if we accept suggestion Nos. 5 and 6 it will not in any way affect the interest of the respondents.

Shri Ranjit Kumar, learned Solicitor General appearing for the Union of India states that the Union Government has already taken enough and effective steps to give wide publicity to the ill effects of fireworks.

In spite of the submission so made by the learned Solicitor General, we intend to pass the following order:

âThe Union Government and all the State Governments will give wide publicity both in print and Electronic media to the ill effects of fireworks and advise people accordingly.
We also direct the Teachers/Lecturers/Assistant Professors/ Professors of the Schools and Colleges to educate the students about the ill effects of the fireworks.ââ

4) Thereafter, this petition was taken up along with certain other connected petitions, including Writ Petition (Civil) No. 13029 of 1985 titled âM.C. Mehta v. Union of Indiaâ and orders dated December 16, 2015 were passed issuing several directions with a view to reducing the levels of air pollution within the NCR, as the issues in those writ petitions pertained to air pollution in Delhi and NCR as well. It may be mentioned that the directions issued therein were general in nature though concerning the problem of air pollution. Thereafter also the instant writ petition, along with the M.C. Mehta case and other cases, came up for hearing and it is not necessary to take note of all those orders.
5) Pertinently, during Diwali of 2016, which was celebrated on October 30, 2016, the air quality in Delhi and NCR worsened alarmingly. In fact, certain reports indicated that the air quality standards in early November of that year were the worst in the world. This prompted the Court to take up IA No.4 filed in this writ petition. After hearing the parties, it passed orders dated November 11, 2016.

6) The petitioners had pressed for interim relief in respect of fireworks, drawing the attention of this Court to the emergent situation that has resulted in worsening the air quality standards in Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR) because of extensive use of fireworks, including firecrackers during Diwali last year. It was pointed out that onset of winter itself deteriorates air quality in this region and it gets aggravated because of festival/marriage season that occurs during these very months. Taking note of the aforesaid factors, particularly impact of fireworks on the ambient air and unhealthy effects thereof which had created unprecedented situation in Delhi, with air pollution going up at alarming levels and making it the most polluted city in the world, the order dated November 11, 2016 was passed. Air pollution had gone up to 29 times above the World Health Organisation  (WHO) standards. In the aforesaid scenario, this Court deemed it proper to pass certain directions vide its order dated November 11, 2016 in IA No.4. Snapping the supply chain of fireworks was considered to be the more practical way of addressing the menace instead of banning the burning the crackers by individuals as it would have been difficult to monitor and enforce the burning of the crackers by the citizenry.

7) In paragraph 18 of the Order dated November 11, 2016 it was clarified that much was left to be heard, discussed and said about the rival claims and contentions. However, the Court hastened to add that harmful effects of fireworks on the ambient air and the lungs, eyes and ears of people was also an acknowledged fact, as can be seen from the following portion of the said paragraph:

â18. We are aware that we are only issuing interim directions, and much is left to be heard, discussed and said about the rival claims and contentions. What is however indisputable is that the harmful effects of fireworks on the ambient air and the lungs, eyes and ears of people. What is also obvious is the extreme nuisance, noise the fireworks cause to citizens particularly the ailing and the aged.
Therefore, though much can be argued as always about the significance and even joy of bursting fireworks, but at the same time (sic), prima facie, a just constitutional balance must overwhelmingly prioritize the harmful effects of this hazardous air on present and future generations, irreversible and imperceptible as they are, over the immediate commercial constraints of the manufacturers and suppliers of fireworksâ¦â
8) In the process, this Court also recognised the duty of the State to ensure a healthy environment in terms of Article 48A of the Constitution of India as well as the duty of the citizens to ensure the same under Article 51A(g) of the Constitution. The Court also reminded itself of the âprecautionary principleâ which mandates that where there are threats of serious and irreversible damage, lack of scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation. In the order the Court had taken note of the deleterious effects of air pollution on the health of the people, particularly the children. Going by all these considerations, the Court passed the following directions:

â19. We thus consider it inappropriate that explosives which are used as fireworks should be available in the market in the NCR till further orders. The mechanism of the law in this regard is clear. Rule 118 of the Explosive Rules, 2008, framed under the Explosives Act, 1884, provides for the manner in which licenses issued under the Explosives Act to store and sell explosives could be suspended or cancelled. Sub-Rule (5) thereof specifically confers on the Central Government a power to suspend or cancel a license if it considers that it is in public interest. This provision also makes it clear that an opportunity to hear the licensee could be dispensed with if the Central Government considers that in public interest. This Court finds that the grave air quality situation in NCR is one such case, where this Court, can intervene and suspend the licenses to store and sell fireworks in the NCR. We direct the Central Government to:
(i) Suspend all such licenses as permit sale of fireworks, wholesale and retail within the territory of NCR.
 (ii) The suspension shall remain in force till further orders of this Court.
(iii) No such licenses shall be granted or renewed till further orders.
20. In addition to the above, we direct the CPCB to study and prepare a report on the harmful effects of the materials which are currently being used in the manufacture of fireworks. The report shall be submitted within a period of three months to this Court.â

9) Since direction was given to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to study and prepare a report of the harmful effects of the materials which are currently being used in the manufacture of fireworks and submit a report within three months, the matter was taken up for consideration thereafter from time to time.

10) Thereafter, the manufacturers of firecrackers as well as license holders also filed applications for modification of the aforesaid interim order. It included IA No. 52448 of 2017. Because of these applications, the matter was heard by a Bench of this Court and orders dated September 12, 2017 were passed in the aforesaid IA. In this order also, the Court recognised severity of air pollution in Delhi and NCR. The Court also discussed the manner in which air quality had worsened due to fireworks during Diwali days in the year 2016. The Court took note of the steps that were taken by different authorities aiming to reduce air  pollution after the passing of orders dated November 11, 2016;

the legal provisions contained in the Explosives Act, 1884 and the Explosive Rules, 2008 framed thereunder; and further steps which were needed in this behalf to reduce the pollution in Delhi and NCR. The Court took note of the fact that number of measures were required to be taken for improving air quality as various factors were contributing to the air pollution. It also specifically mentioned that one of the reasons was burning of crackers/fireworks during Diwali. On that basis, the Court also accepted that one of the possible methods for reducing it during Diwali is by continuing the suspension of licenses for the sale of fireworks, thereby implicitly prohibiting the bursting of fireworks.
However, at the same time, the Court expressed the opinion that continuing the suspension of licenses might be too radical a step to take for the present. It was deemed appropriate to adopt a graded and balanced approach, which is necessary, that will reduce and gradually eliminate air pollution in Delhi and in the NCR caused by the bursting of fireworks. In the process, the Court took into consideration the interest of those who had already been granted a valid permanent licence to posses and sell fireworks in Delhi and the NCR. We would like to reproduce the following paragraphs from the said order:
 â67. The right to health coupled with the right to breathe clean air leaves no manner of doubt that it is important that air pollution deserves to be eliminated and one of the possible methods of reducing it during Diwali is by continuing the suspension of licences for the sale of fireworks and therefore implicitly, prohibiting the bursting of fireworks.

68. In our considered opinion, continuing the suspension of licences might be too radical a step to take for the present â a graded and balanced approach is necessary that will reduce and gradually eliminate air pollution in Delhi and in the NCR caused by the bursting of fireworks. At the same time it is necessary to ensure that injustice is not caused to those who have already been granted a valid permanent licence to possess and sell fireworks in Delhi and the NCR. The graded and balanced approach is not intended to dilute our primary concern which is and remains the health of everybody and the human right to breathe good quality air or at least not be compelled to breathe poor quality air. Generally speaking this must take precedence over the commercial or other interest of the applicant and those granted a permanent licence to possess and sell fireworks.

69. But, from the material before us, it cannot be said with any great degree of certainty that the extremely poor quality of air in Delhi in November and December 2016 was the result only of bursting fireworks around Diwali. Certainly, there were other causes as well, but even so the contribution of the bursting of fireworks cannot be glossed over. Unfortunately, neither is it possible to give an accurate or relative assessment of the contribution of the other identified factors nor the contribution of bursting fireworks to the poor air quality in Delhi and in the NCR. Consequently, a complete ban on the sale of fireworks would be an extreme step that might not be fully warranted by the facts available to us. There is, therefore, some justification for modifying the interim order passed on 11 th November, 2016 and lifting the suspension of the permanent licences.

70. At the same time, it cannot be forgotten that admittedly there is a huge quantity of fireworks in Delhi and in the NCR and the figure has been provided to us by the applicant. Similarly, there can be no doubt that the Delhi Police had issued a large number of temporary licences in  2016 and it would not be unreasonable to assume that around and during Diwali, there would have been some illegal temporary shops set up, whether known or not known to the police. We do not have the figures with regard to the NCR, but we assume that like in Delhi, a large number of temporary licences have been issued for the possession and sale of fireworks. Therefore, there is a need to regulate the availability and sale of fireworks in Delhi and the NCR.â

11) It was followed by the following directions:

â71. As mentioned above, the health of the people in Delhi and in the NCR must take precedence over any commercial or other interest of the applicant or any of the permanent licensees and, therefore, a graded regulation is necessary which would eventually result in a prohibition. Taking all factors into consideration, we are of the view that the following orders and directions are required to be issued and we do so:
(1) The directions issued by this Court in Sadar Bazar Fire Works (Pucca Shop) Association shall stand partially modified to the extent that they are not in conformity with the Explosives Rules which shall be implemented in full by the concerned authorities. Safety from fire hazards is one of our concerns in this regard.
(2) Specifically, Rule 15 relating to marking on explosives and packages and Rule 84 relating to temporary shops for possession and sale of fireworks during festivals of the Explosives Rules shall be strictly enforced. This should not be construed to mean that the other Rules need not be enforced â all Rules should be enforced. But if the fireworks do not conform to the requirements of Rules 15 and 84, they cannot be sold in the NCR, including Delhi and this prohibition is absolute.
(3) The directions issued and restrictions imposed in the order passed by this Court on 18th July, 2005 in Noise Pollution (V) shall continue to be in force.
(4) The concerned police authorities and the District Magistrates will ensure that fireworks are not burst in silence zones that is, an area at least 100 meters away from hospitals, nursing homes, primary and district health-
 care centres, educational institutions, courts, religious places or any other area that may be declared as a silence zone by the concerned authorities.

(5) The Delhi Police is directed to reduce the grant of temporary licences by about 50% of the number of licences granted in 2016. The number of temporary licences should be capped at 500. Similarly, the States in the NCR are restrained from granting more than 50% of the number of temporary licences granted in 2016. The area of distribution of the temporary licences is entirely for the authorities to decide.

(6) The Union of India will ensure strict compliance with the Notification GSR No. 64(E) dated 27th January, 1992 regarding the ban on import of fireworks. The Union of India is at liberty to update and revise this notification in view of the passage of time and further knowledge gained over the last 25 years and issue a fresh notification, if necessary.

(7) The Department of Education of the Government of NCT of Delhi and the corresponding Department in other States in the NCR shall immediately formulate a plan of action, in not more than 15 days, to reach out to children in all the schools through the school staff, volunteers and NGOs to sensitize and educate school children on the health hazards and ill-effects of breathing polluted air, including air that is polluted due to fireworks. School children should be encouraged to reduce, if not eliminate, the bursting of fireworks as a part of any festivities. (8) The Government of NCT of Delhi and other States in the NCR may consider interacting with established medical institutions for issuing advisories cautioning people about the health hazards of bursting fireworks.

(9) The interim direction issued by this Court on 31st July, 2017 prohibiting the use of compounds of antimony, lithium, mercury, arsenic and lead in the manufacture of fireworks is made absolute. In addition, the use of strontium chromate in the manufacture of fireworks is prohibited.

(10) Fireworks containing aluminum, sulphur, potassium and barium may be sold in Delhi and in the NCR, provided the composition already approved by PESO is maintained.  It is the responsibility of PESO to ensure compliance of the standards it has formulated.

(11) Since there are enough fireworks available for sale in Delhi and the NCR, the transport of fireworks into Delhi and the NCR from outside the region is prohibited and the concerned law enforcement authorities will ensure that there is no further entry of fireworks into Delhi and the NCR till further orders. In our opinion, even 50,00,000 kg of fireworks is far more than enough for Dussehra and Diwali in 2017. The permanent licensees are at liberty to exhaust their existing stock of fireworks in Delhi and the NCR and, if that is not possible, take measures to transport the stocks outside Delhi and the NCR.

(12) The suspension of permanent licences as directed by the order dated 11th November, 2016 is lifted for the time being. This might require a review after Diwali depending on the ambient air quality post Diwali. However, it is made explicit that the sale of fireworks by the permanent licensees must conform to the directions given above and must be fully in compliance with the Explosives Rules. We were informed that the permanent licences were issued by PESO and therefore the responsibility is on PESO to ensure compliance.

(13) While lifting the suspension on the permanent licences already granted, we put these licensees on notice for Dussehra and Diwali in 2018 that they will be permitted to possess and sell only 50% of the quantity permitted in 2017 and that this will substantially reduce over the next couple of years. The permanent licensees are at liberty to file objections to this proposed direction within 30 days from today and thereafter the objections if any will be heard and decided. If no objections are filed, this direction will become absolute without any further reference to any licensee.

(14) Since there is a lack of clarity on the safety limits of various metals and constituents used in fireworks, a research study must be jointly carried out by the CPCB and the FRDC laying down appropriate standards for ambient air quality in relation to the bursting of fireworks and the release of their constituents in the air. While Schedule VII of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 does deal with several metals, but as we have seen there are several other metals or constituents of fireworks that have not been  studied by the CPCB and no standards have been laid down with regard to the concentration of these metals or constituents in the ambient air. The CPCB has assured us that it will complete the exercise by 15th September, 2017 but keeping in mind its track record subsequent to the order dated 11th November, 2016 this does not seem possible. Therefore, we grant time to the CPCB to come out with definite standards on or before 30th September, 2017.

(15) In any event, a research study also needs to be conducted on the impact of bursting fireworks during Dussehra and Diwali on the health of the people. We, therefore, appoint a Committee to be chaired by the Chairperson of the CPCB and consisting of officers at the appropriate level from the National Physical Laboratory, Delhi, the Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences, Timarpur, Delhi, the Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur, scientists from the State Pollution Control Boards, the Fire Development and Research Centre, Sivakasi and Nagpur and the National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) nominated by the Chairperson of the CPCB to submit a report in this regard preferably on or before 31st December, 2017. (16) Keeping in mind the adverse effects of air pollution, the human right to breathe clean air and the human right to health, the Central Government and other authorities should consider encouraging display fireworks through community participation rather than individual bursting of fireworks.â

12) After the aforesaid order was passed, many applications were filed, from both sides, seeking modification of some of the aforesaid directions. Insofar as the petitioners are concerned, in their application for modification, they prayed for removal of Directions Nos. 5 and 10 to 13, which was in essence a prayer for restoration of earlier order dated November 11, 2016. Insofar as fireworks manufacturers, traders and license holders of the  fireworks/firecrackers are concerned, they wanted that relaxation given in the order dated September 12, 2017 be further liberalised.",lb
"PER G.MANJUNATHA (A.M):


This appeal filed by the assessee is directed against order of the Learned Principal Commissioner of Income tax, Central-3, Mumbai, dated 06/11/2019 u/s 263 of the I.T.Act, 1961 for the AY 2014-15.

2. The assessee has raised the following grounds of appeal.

1. That in the facts and circumstance of the case and in law, the show cause notice u/s 263 of the Act was issued with pre- mediated mind, as such, the show cause as well as consequential proceeding is bad-in-law and liable to be quashed.

2. That on the facts & circumstances of the case, the impugned order passed by the Ld. CIT u/s 263 is time barred as per the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Alagendran Finance Limited [(2007) 293 ITR 1] in so far as the Ld. Pr. CIT set-aside the order for fresh enquiry with ITA No.7615/Mum/2019 K.R.Construction respect expenses and unsecured loan, which was the subject matter of original scrutiny assessment proceedings and not re-assessment proceeding, as such, the order u/s 263 is bad-in4aw and liable to be quashed.

3. That in the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the impugned order is bad in law in so far as the Ld. Pr. CIT seeks to revise the reassessment order u/s 147 of the Act which is itself bad in law and liable to be quashed.

4. That in the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the re- assessment order passed u/s 147 r.w.s 143(3) of the Act is bad in law in so far as the notice u/s 148 had been issued without the appropriate approval u/s 151 of the Act, as such, the revisionary proceedings with respect to the reassessment order which is itself non-est in law is not sustainable and is liable to be quashed. That the approval is taken from Additional CIT instead of Joint CIT as required u/s 151 of the Act.

5. That in the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the reason to believe recorded for reopening of assessment u/s 148 is bad in law in so far as it has been recorded that sub-contract expenses amounting to Rs. 2,35,25,258/- has escaped assessment, whereas the same addition had also been made in the original scrutiny assessment proceedings as being bogus, as such, the impugned reasons are clearly without any application of mind, bad in law and liable to be quashed and also the consequential revision order u/s 263.

6. That in the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, without prejudice to the above, the sanction granted to reason to believe is bad in law in so far as the Addl.

7. That in the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the impugned order is bad in law in so far as the Ld. Pr. CIT erred in invoking jurisdiction u/s 263 of the Act without appreciating that if no addition is made on the issue for which reason were recorded, no other additions can be made with respect to issues for which no reasons were recorded.

8. That in the facts and circumstances of the case and in law and without prejudice to the aforesaid ground, the Pr. CIT has grossly erred in directing the Ld. AO to examine the issue with respect to unsecured loan without appreciation the fact that she has already directed the Ld. AO to assess the income as per applicable net profit after rejecting the books of accounts, so no item of books can be examined after the income is to be computed on estimated net profit basis.

9. That in the facts and circumstances of the case and in law and without prejudice to the aforesaid ground, the Pr. CIT has grossly erred in directing the Ld. AO to examine the issue with respect to expense without appreciation the fact that she has already directed the Ld.

10. Your appellant prays for leave to add, alter and amend all or any of the above grounds of appeal

3. The brief facts of the case are that the assessee is engaged in the business of Civil construction work, filed its return of income for AY 2014-15 on 29/11/2014, declaring total income of Rs.7,47,37,490/-. The assessment was completed u/s 143(3) of the I.T.Act, 1961 on 30/12/2016, determining the total income at Rs. 9,82,62,750/-. Subsequently, a survey action u/s 133A of the I.T.Act, 1961 was carried out at the business premise of the assessee on 30/08/2016. During the course of survey proceedings, a copy of the balance sheet for AY 2014-15 certified by the auditors on 31/08/2014 was found and as per the said balance sheet the turnover was found declared at Rs.219,25,42,121/-. Consequent to survey u/s 133A of the Act, the assessment has been reopened u/s 147 of the I.T.Act, 1961 by issuing notice u/s 148 of the Act, dated 02/02/2018. In response to notice u/s 148 of the Act, the assessee has filed return of income on 09/02/2018, declaring total income at Rs.9,82,62,750/-. The assessee had also requested for copy of reasons recorded for reopening of the assessment and as requested, the reasons for reopening of the assessment was supplied to the assessee, vide letter dated 12/02/2018. The assesee has filed its objections for reopening assessment on 26/02/2018, which has been reproduced at para 3 on pages 4 to 11 of assessment order. The Ld. AO has disposed -off objections filed by ITA No.7615/Mum/2019 K.R.Construction the assesee, vide letter dated 27/02/2018. Thereafter, the assessment has been completed u/s 143(3), r.w.s. 147 of the I.T.Act, 1961on 10/05/2018 and determined the total income at Rs.9,82,62,750/-, without making any additions towards suppression of gross receipts and bogus labour contract charges.

4. Subsequently, the Ld.PCIT, Central-3, Mumbai has issued show cause notice u/s 263 of the I.T.Act, 1961, dated 11/07/2019 and called upon the assessee to explain as to why the assessment order passed by the Ld. AO u/s 143(3), rws 147 of the I.T.Act, 1961, dated 10/05/2018 shall not be revised under the provisions of section 263 of the Act, for the reasons stated in his show cause notice. The Ld.PCIT, in the said show cause notice has taken up, the issue of suppression of gross receipts on the basis of reasons recorded for reopening of assessment, which is further supported by evidences found during the course of survey in form of second set of financial statements prepared by the assessee for the impugned assessment year. According to the Ld. PCIT although, the Ld. AO seems to have verified, the issue of suppression of gross receipts, during the re-assessment proceedings, but he has failed to take note of evidences gathered during the course of survey in form of second set of financial statements, as per which the turnover shown for the year under consideration was at Rs.219.25 crores, whereas the turnover declared in return of income filed for the year was at Rs.132.11 crores. The Ld.PCIT, further stated that although, both audit reports were duly signed by the partners and by the auditors the firm, but the audited financial statements showing lower receipts was filed before the income-tax department along with return of income. The Ld. AO during reassessment proceedings has failed to ITA No.7615/Mum/2019 K.R.Construction take note of vital facts gathered during the course of survey, while concluding the assessment, which resulted in erroneous order passed, insofar as, it is prejudicial to the interest of revenue. The Ld.PCIT, further noted that although, there is a discrepancy in unsecured loans, which has been shown at Rs. 45.58 lacs in the financial statements filed before the department, but the same have been shown at Rs. 2.62 cores in the parallel financial statements, however no enquiry has been made regarding said discrepancy in unsecured loans, as per two set of financial statements. Therefore, he opined that the assessment order passed by the Ld. AO is erroneous, insofar as, it is prejudicial to the interest of the revenue and accordingly, issued a show cause notice.

5. In response to show cause notice, the assessee, vide letter dated 18/07/2019, 17/09/2019, 09/10/2019 and 22/10/2019 has submitted that the assessment order passed by the Ld. AO is neither erroneous, nor it is prejudicial to the interest of the revenue, because the issue of suppression of turnover has been thoroughly examined by the Ld. AO in reassessment proceedings, which is clearly evident from the fact that the assessment has been reopened for the purpose of verification of suppression of turnover on the basis of findings of survey proceedings initiated against the assessee u/s 133A of the I.T.Act, 1961. The assessee, further submitted that it has explained the discrepancy in turnover declared in two set of financial statements before the Ld. AO during the reassessment proceedings, as per which the accountant made a mistake, while taking out the printout of the trial balance, for the period from 01/04/2013 to 31/08/2014 instead of 01/04/2013 to 31/03/2014 and as a result of which, the gross turnover for the selected period was ITA No.7615/Mum/2019 K.R.Construction at Rs. 219.25 crores. The auditor, who signed by the balance sheet has also, prepared the financial statements for a period of 17 months from 01/04/2013 to 31/08/2014 on the assumption that the assesee requires financial statements for a period of 17 months and accordingly, the turnover has been shown at Rs. 219.25 crores. But, fact remains that the assessee has reconciled difference between turnover shown in parallel set of financial statements along with necessary evidences, including copies of TDS certificates issued by the principles and AIR information available in income tax data base, as per which, the turnover for the impugned assessment year is at Rs.132.11 crores. The Ld. AO after considering relevant submissions of the assessee has completed the assessment without making any additions towards suppression in turnover. Therefore, it cannot be said that the assessment order passed by the Ld. AO is erroneous, insofar as, it is prejudicial to the interest of the revenue. The assessee further submitted that as regards, bogus labour contract charges, although the assessment has been reopened, in respect of bogus labour contract charges, but, fact remains that very same issue has been considered by the Ld. AO in original assessment proceedings u/s 143(3) of the Act, and made additions towards alleged bogus bills from certain parties, in respect of labour contract charges and accordingly, during the reassessment proceedings having noticed the fact that the issue has been considered in the original assessment proceedings, he has chosen not to make any additions on the issue. Therefore, it is incorrect on the part of Ld.PCIT to alleged that the Ld. AO has not verified the issue of labour contract charges, which resulted in erroneous order passed, insofar as, it is prejudicial to the interest of the revenue.

ITA No.7615/Mum/2019 K.R.Construction

6. The Ld.PCIT after considering relevant submissions of the assessee and also taken note of various facts, including the survey proceedings conducted u/s 133A of the Act, and consequent evidences in form of parallel set of financial statements, opined that the assessment order passed by the Ld. AO is erroneous, insofar as, it is prejudicial to the interest of the revenue. He, further noted that although, the Ld. AO seems to have been verified issue of suppression of turnover, but, fact remains that the Ld. AO never ever has made any attempt to call for necessary details, even though there are large differences in expenditure claim to have incurred for payment to contractor and sub-contractor, power and fuel expenses, tender expenses and staff welfare expenses, which is evident from the fact that he has simply accepted the story of a mistake given by the assessee, in respect of parallel set of financial statements prepared for 17 months and concluded assessment u/s 143(3) r.w.s. 147 of the I.T.Act, 1961. The Ld.PCIT, further noted that the Ld. AO not even verified two set of financial statements with reference to unsecured loans, where there is a huge difference, in respect of unsecured loans shown in two balance sheets, however details of the date of the return of these loans and consequent application of provisions of 68 of the Act has not been examined by the Ld. AO. Therefore, he opined that the assessment order passed by the Ld. AO is erroneous, insofar as it is prejudicial to the interest of the revenue and accordingly, set aside the assessment order and direct the Ld. AO to re-do the assessment and determine the net profit by taking note of profit declared by the assesee for the year. Aggrieved by the Ld.PCIT order, the assessee is in appeal before us.

ITA No.7615/Mum/2019 K.R.Construction

7. The Ld. AR for the assessee submitted that the Ld.PCIT has erred in invoking jurisdiction u/s 263 of the Act, without appreciating that if, no addition is made on the issue for which reason was recorded, no other addition can be made with respect to issues for which no reasons were recorded and consequently, directions for making other enquiries /additions is not permitted under the provisions of law. The Ld. AR, further submitted that it is a fact of matter, the assessment has been originally completed u/s 143(3) of the Act, where the Ld. AO has made additions towards alleged bogus expenditure in form of labor contract charges. The assessment has been subsequently reopened for the reasons recorded, as per which there is allegation of suppression of turnover on the basis of findings of survey conducted u/s 133A of the Act, and also in the aspect of bogus labor contract. During the course of reassessment proceedings, the assessee has explained the difference between turnover reported in two set of financial statements and also, explained the issue of bogus labour contract expenses with reference specific questionnaire issued by the Ld. AO along with notice u/s 142(1), dated 04/07/2016 and 20/07/2016, for which, the assesee has filed a detailed written submissions, vide letter, dated 29/07/2016 explaining the reasons for difference in turnover reported in two set of financial statements. The assessee had also explained the issue of bogus labour contract expenses and filed necessary evidences to prove that similar amount has been added in original assessment u/s 143(3) of the Act. The Ld. AO on being satisfied with explanation furnished by the assesse has completed assessment u/s 143(3) r.w.s. 147 of the Act, which cannot be termed as erroneous, insofar as it is prejudicial to the interest of the revenue.

ITA No.7615/Mum/2019 K.R.Construction

8. The Ld. AR, further submitted that insofar as difference in turnover, as per two set of financial statements, the assesee has filed various details, including TDS certificates and reconciled turnover reported in financial statements to Form 26AS available in ITS data base and explained that the assessee has executed works contracts for government agencies, like BMC etc. The assessee has also filed various details, in respect of labour contract expenses incurred for the year. The Ld. AO after verification of necessary details filed by the assessee has completed the reassessment proceedings initiated u/s 147 of the Act, without making any addition/adjustments to total income declared for the year. He, further submitted that it is a settled position of law that once, the reasons recorded for reopening of assessment is fails and no addition is made on this aspect, then the Ld. AO is precluded from making any other additions, even though he has come across certain issues during the assessment proceedings. Once, the Ld. AO himself is precluded from making any additions, and then directing the Ld. AO to make enquiry/addition on other issues is outside the scope of provisions of section 263 of the Act. The Ld. AR, further submitted that, it is also settled position of law that an authority framing an assessment or revision of any proceedings shall confine its jurisdiction to the issues questioned in the reasons recorded for reopening of assessment or show cause notice issued for revision of proceedings without any modifications or improvement to show cause notice issued in assessment proceedings. The meaning thereby is that if, show cause notice is issued for making certain enquiries on certain issues, then proceedings should be confined to those issues only. In this case, the Ld.PCIT has issued show cause ITA No.7615/Mum/2019 K.R.Construction notice to revise the assessment order on the issue of suppression of turnover and alleged bogus labour contract expenses, whereas in 263 proceedings, he has directed the Ld. AO to examine the issue of various expenses claimed in two set of financial statements, although the scope of his revisional powers is limited to the issues questioned in show cause notice. Therefore, he submitted that the initiation of proceedings u/s 263 is bad in law and liable to be set aside. In this regard, he relied upon the following judicial precedents:-

CIT vs. Alagendran Finance Ltd (2007) (7) TMI 304 CIT vs. JET Airways (195 Taxmann 117) Hindustan Lever Ltd vs. R B Wadkar (137 Taxmann 479) My Car (Pune) P.

9. The Ld. DR, on the other hand ,strongly supporting order of the Ld.PCIT submitted that the Commissioner has brought out various facts in his 263 proceedings to prove that the assessment order passed by the Ld. AO is erroneous, insofar as, it is prejudicial to the interest of the revenue, which is evident from the fact that although, the evidence was found during the course of survey proceedings u/s 133A of the Act, in respect of difference in turnover reported for the year, but the Ld. AO has accepted the arguments of the assessee of the theory of mistake committed by an accountant in preparation of financial statement without any effort to find out the correct facts with regard to turnover reported in two set of documents. The Ld. DR, further submitted that it is a settled position of law that there is a vast difference between the reassessment and revision, where in cases of revision, if the commissioner satisfied that the assessment ITA No.7615/Mum/2019 K.R.Construction order passed by the Ld. AO is erroneous, insofar as , it is prejudicial to the interest of the revenue, then he is very much within his powers to invoke jurisdiction to ascertain correct facts with regard to the proceedings to known, whether the Ld. AO has carried out required enquiries to be conducted in accordance with law. In this case, it is very clear from the facts brought out by the Ld.PCIT that the Ld. AO had committed an error in not making any further enquiry into details as regards difference in turnover reported, as per two set of audited financial statements and also, various expenses claimed in those set of financial statements, but simply accepted the arguments of the assessee and concluded the assessment, which resulted in erroneous order passed, which caused prejudice to the interest of the revenue. Therefore, the Ld.PCIT was right in invoking jurisdiction u/s 263 of the I.T.Act, 1961 and there is no reason to interfere in the findings recorded by the Ld.PCIT.

10. We have heard both the parties, perused the material available on record and gone through orders of the authorities below along with plethora of case laws cited by both the parties. The provisions of 263 of the I.T.Act, 1961 provides inherent powers to the Commissioner or Principal Commissioner to invoke jurisdiction to revise the assessment order, if he considers that any order passed by the Ld. AO is erroneous, insofar as, it is prejudicial to the interest of the revenue. The language used by the Legislature in s. 263 is to the effect that the CIT may interfere in revision if he considers that the order passed by the ITO is erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue. It is quite clear that two things must co-exist in order to give jurisdiction to the CIT to interfere in revision. The order of the ITO in question must not only be erroneous but also the error in the ITO's order must be of such a kind that it can be said of it that it is prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue. In other words, merely because the officer's order is erroneous, the CIT cannot interfere. Again, merely because the order of the officer is prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue, then again, that is not ITA No.7615/Mum/2019 K.R.Construction enough to confer jurisdiction on the CIT to interfere in revision. These two elements must co-exist. This is because, the first of the two requirements namely, (i) the order is erroneous and (ii) the same is also prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue, is not satisfied. Similarly, if an order is erroneous but not prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue, then also the power of suo-moto revision cannot be exercised. Any and every erroneous order cannot be the subject- matter of revision because the second requirement also must be fulfilled. There must be some prima facie material on record to show that tax which was lawfully exigible has not been imposed or that by the application of the relevant statute on an incorrect or incomplete interpretation a lesser tax than what was just has been imposed.

11. The phrase 'prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue' has to be read in conjunction with an erroneous order passed by the AO. Every loss of revenue as a consequence of an order of AO cannot be treated as prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue, for example, when an ITO adopted one of the courses permissible in law and it has resulted in loss of revenue; or where two views are possible and the ITO has taken one view with which the CIT does not agree, it cannot be treated as an erroneous order prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue unless the view taken by the ITO is unsustainable in law. An order of assessment passed by the ITO without making necessary enquiries on certain important points connected with the assessment would be erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue, when the ITO is expected to make an enquiry of a particular item of income and he does not make an enquiry as expected, that would be a ground for the CIT to interfere with the order passed by the ITO since such an order passed by the ITA No.7615/Mum/2019 K.R.Construction ITO is erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of Revenue. Where the ITO had made enquiries in regard to the issues by a specific questionnaire for which the assessee has given detailed explanation in that regard by a letter in writing and all these are part of the record of the case and the claim was allowed by the ITO on being satisfied with the explanation of the assessee, such decision of the ITO cannot be held to be erroneous simply because in his order he did not make an elaborate discussion in that regard

12. In light of above legal position, if you examine the facts of present case, one needs to understand whether, the assessment order passed by the Ld. AO u/s 143(3) r.w.s. 147 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 is erroneous insofar as, it is prejudicial to the interest of the revenue. Admittedly, the assessment in question was originally completed u/s 143(3) of the I.T.Act, 1961, where the Ld. AO has made additions towards labour charges incurred by the assessee under the head labour contact expenses and made additions of Rs.2,35,25,258/-, in respect of payments made to six parties as listed by the Ld. AO in the reasons recorded for reopening of assessment. It is also not in dispute that the assessment has been reopened u/s 147 of the Act, for the reasons recorded, as per which the impugned assessment has been reopened, in respect of issues related to suppression of gross receipts on the basis of two parallel set of financial statements prepared by the assessee, which was found during the course of survey conducted u/s 133A of the Act. As per said two set of financial statements, the assessee has reported turnover of Rs.219.25 crores in one set of financial statements prepared for a period of 17 months 01/04/2013 to 31/08/2014 and in another set of financial statements prepared for period of 12 months ITA No.7615/Mum/2019 K.R.Construction from 01/04/2013 to 31/03/2014, which was also part of return filed for the year, the turnover has been shown at Rs.132.11 crores. The assesee has explained difference between turnover shown in two set of financial statement, while filing objections to reopening assessment u/s 147 of the I.T.Act, 1961 and explained that the turnover reported in financial statements prepared and audited for the year for a period of 12 months is supported by necessary TDS certificates issues by principals and also, which is matched with data available in Form 26AS of IT data base. The assessee, further, clarified that it is executing works contract for government agencies and bills are certified by competent authority and after that payment has been made after deducting applicable TDS as per law. The TDS deducted by the principals and claimed by the assesse in return of income filed for the year is matched with data available in Form 26AS. The assesse has also clarified that the financial statements prepared for a period of 17 months is on the basis of trial balance generated by an accountant by mistake of facts, as per which the turnover was at Rs.219.25 crores and the auditor has also prepared and certified second set of financial statements on the pretext of assesee requires financial statements for a period of 17 months for some specified purpose. During reassessment proceedings, the said mistake has been clarified with necessary evidences. The Ld. AO after being satisfied with explanation furnished by the assessee has completed the assessment without making any additions towards suppressed turnover. Similarly, in respect of alleged bogus labour contract expenses, although the assessment has been reopened on said issue, but no addition has been made during the reassessment proceedings, for the reasons that this very same issue has been considered in original assessment proceedings and addition has ITA No.7615/Mum/2019 K.R.Construction been made for an amount of Rs.2,35,25,258/-. These facts are undisputed by the lower authorities. In fact, the Ld.PCIT has accepted the fact that the Ld. AO seems to have verified the difference in turnover with reference to various documents filed by the assessee, including copies of TDS certificates, certified bills issued by principles, VAT audit report in Form 702 and other evidences, which is evident from the fact that in 263 proceedings, the Ld.PCIT had categorically accepted that the Ld. AO has carried out with necessary enquiries with regard to difference in turnover, however he has directed the Ld. AO to verify the issue of turnover declared in two set of financial statements and also, examine various expenses claimed in two set of financial statements.

13. In this factual background, if you examine revision order passed by the PCIT u/s 263 of the Act, one needs to understand, whether the exercise of powers by the Ld.PCIT is within the scope of provision of section 263 of the I.T.Act, 1961. It is a settled position of law that if, no addition is made on the issue, for which reasons were recorded for reopening, no other additions can be made with respect to issues for which no reasons were recorded. The Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of CIT vs Jet Airways India Ltd. (2011) 331 ITR 236 has categorically held that if, the Ld. AO accepts the contention of the assessee and holds that the income for which, he had initially formed a reason to believe that it had escaped assessment, as a matter of fact, not escaped assessment, it is not open to him to independently assess some other income and if, he intends do so, a fresh notice u/s 148 would be necessary, the legality of which would be tested in the event of a challenge by the assessee. A similar view has been expressed by the Hon'ble ITA No.7615/Mum/2019 K.R.Construction Rajasthan High court in case of shri. Ram Singh (306 ITR 343) and Punjab & Haryana High Court in case of Atlas Cycle Industries (180 ITR 319). The Hon'be Delhi High Court in case of Software Consultants (21 Taxmann.com 155) held that where the AO did not make any additions on issues inrespect of which reasons were recordrd for issue of notice u/s 148, a general inference is that the Ao could not have made addition on account new issue and, thus Commissioner could not have exercised revisional jurisdiction. The sum and substance of ratios laid down by Hon'ble High Courts is that if, reasons recorded for reopening of assessment on a particular issue and in reassessment proceedings, no addition is made on this count, then the Ld. AO is debarred from making any other additions, which he come across during reassessment proceedings. If you apply above legal principles to revision proceedings, the obvious inference is that when AO could not have made any additions other than the issues for which reopening is made, then the CIT could also have interefered with hose issues which are not subject matter of reassessment proceedings.

14. In this legal and factual background, if you see the facts of present case, the assessment has been reopened, in respect of suppression of turnover reported in two set of financial statements. In reassessment proceedings, the Ld. AO has never made any additions towards suppression of turnover, as alleged by him in the reasons recorded for reopening of assessment. It is also an admitted fact that the Ld. AO has not made any other additions in respect of any other issues in reassessment proceedings. Therefore, once the Ld. AO himself is precluded from making any other additions, then it is not open for the Ld.PCIT to question some other issues in revision ITA No.7615/Mum/2019 K.R.Construction proceedings which is not at all subject matter of reassessment. Further, it is also a matter of fact that any proceedings initiated under any provisions of this Act, i.e. whether it is reopening or revision, the proceedings shall be confined to the issues questioned in either, reasons recoded for reopening of assessment or show cause notice issued for initiating the proceedings u/s 263 of the Act. In other words, if the proceedings has been taken up under the provision of section 263 of the Act, to examine a particular issue, then Ld.PCIT should restrict himself to the issues questioned in his show cause notice, but he cannot proceed to enlarge the scope of proceedings to any other issues, which is not find place in show cause notice issued for this purpose. This view is fortified by the decision of Hon'ble Bombay High court in case of Hindustan Lever Limited (137 Taxmann 479) where it has been held that the reasons are required to be read as they were recorded by the Assessing Officer, and no substitution or deletion is permissible. In this case, the Ld.PCIT had taken up proceedings u/s 263 of the Act, for the purpose of examining the issue of difference in turnover reported in two set of financial statement and also, difference in unsecured loans reported in two set of financial statement prepared by the assessee. Admittedly, the issue of suppression of turnover was a subject matter of reassessment proceedings and the genisis of issue orginated from survey proceedings conducted u/s 133A and which was followed by reasons recorded for reopening of assessment. However, in reassessment proceedings, there is no addition was made, in respect of suppression of turnover. It is also a matter of fact that it is not a case of the Ld.PCIT that the Ld. AO has never examined the issue of turnover in reassessment proceedings, in fact the assessee has filed detailed written submissions, while filing ITA No.7615/Mum/2019 K.R.Construction objections for reassessment and the same has been reproduced by the Ld. AO in his assessment order. Therefore, it cannot be said that, the Ld. AO has not conducted required enquiries he ought to have been conducted under the law in respect of suppression of turnover. It is a settled position of law that once, the issues on which, the revision proceedings was initiated were already subjected to verification by the Ld. AO during assessment proceedings, then the same are outside the scope of jurisdiction of power of the commissioner u/s 263 of the I.T.Act, 1961, because the CIT cannot replace his views on the issues in guise of inadequate enquiry as held by the Hon'ble Bombay High court in case of CIT vs Gabrieal India Limited (1993) 203 ITR 108. This view was further supported by the decision of Hon,ble Bombay High Court in case of CIT vs. Nirav Modi (2017) 390 ITR 292. In this case, on perusal of facts, we find that the Ld.PCIT has questioned the issue of suppression of turnover, which is also a matter of deliberation by the Ld. AO during the reassessment proceedings and hence, we are of the considered view that the Ld. PCIT was completely erred in invoking jurisdiction to revise the assessment order passed by the Ld. AO u/s 143(3) r.w.s. 147 of the I.T.Act, 1961, in respect of very same issue of suppression of turnover, which was very much deliberated by the Ld. AO during the assessment proceedings.

15. Coming back to other part of proceedings taken up by the Ld.PCIT. The Ld.PCIT has directed the Ld. AO to examine the expenses and determine the net profit after considering the profit declared by the assessee for the year under consideration, after taking note of the fact that there is large number of difference in certain expenses claimed in two set of financial statements. We find ITA No.7615/Mum/2019 K.R.Construction that first and foremost the Ld.PCIT has exceeded his jurisdiction conferred upon by him u/s 263 of the Act, because the show cause notice is very clearly stated that the assessment order is erroneous, insofar as, it is prejudicial to the interest of the revenue, in respect of the issue of suppression of turnover. Therefore, once the Ld.PCIT having found that the issue of suppression of turnover was considered by the Ld. AO, at the time of assessment proceedings, he should have confined its scope of revisional powers to the issue of suppression of turnover instead of going to the issue of expenses claimed by the assessee and profit declared for the year under consideration. Because, the issue of various expenses claimed in two set of financial statements was neither, subject matter of reassessment proceedings u/s 147 of the Act, nor find place in show cause notice issued by the Ld.PCIT u/s 263 of the Act, 1961. Therefore, we are of the considered view that the Ld.PCIT having accepted the fact that the Ld.AO has examined the issue of suppression of turnover should have confined the scope of his revisional powers to the issue, which he had questioned in his show cause notice, rather than going to the issue of various expenditure, which is not at all a subject matter of proceedings u/s 147 of the I.T.Act, 1961. As, we have already stated in earlier paragraph, when AO himself is precluded from making any other additions in reassessment proceedings, when he failed to make additions on the issues on which reasons for reopening of assessment was recorded, then certainly in our consider view the Ld.PCIT is also precluded from taking those issues in revisional proceedings u/s 263 of the I.T.Act, 1961. Further, the issue of various expenses questioned by the Ld.PCIT was explained by the assessee during the assessment proceedings with reference to two set of financial statements and the ITA No.7615/Mum/2019 K.R.Construction Ld. AO has accepted the claim of the assessee and completed assessment without making any additions on the issues. It is also a matter of fact that the two set of financial statement have been prepared for two different periods and the difference of income and expenditure recorded in said financial statements has been explained before the Ld. AO, during reassessment proceedings. Therefore, we are of the considered view that the Ld.PCIT was incorrect in coming to the conclusion that the Ld. AO ought to have carried out necessary enquiries with regard to various expenditure claimed in two set of financial statements and also, the profit declared by the assessee for the year under consideration in comparison with average profitability of certain comparables furnished by the assessee. We, therefore are of the opinion that the Ld.PCIT has gone beyond the scope of his revisional powers conferred on him by the provision of section 263 of the I.T.Act, 1961.

16. Coming back to the case laws relied upon the Ld. AR for the assessee. The assessee has relied upon the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court, in case of Malabar Industrial Company Limited vs CIT (243 ITR 83). We find that Hon'ble Supreme Court, while considering issue of revisional powers of the commissioner u/s 263 of the I.T.Act, 1961 has held as under:-

The phrase ""prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue"" has to be read in conjunction with an erroneous order passed by the Assessing Officer. Every loss of revenue as a consequence of an order of the Assessing Officer cannot be treated as prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue. For example, when an Income-lax Officer adopted cine of the courses permissible in law and it has resulted in loss of Revenue -or where two views are possible and the Income-tax Officer has taken one view with which the Commissioner does not agree, it cannot be treated as an case erroneous order prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue, unless the view taken by the Income-tax Officer is unsustainable in law. It has been held by this court that where a sum not earned by a person is assessed as income in his hands on his so offering me order passed by the ITA No.7615/Mum/2019 K.R.Construction Assessing Officer accepting the same as such will be erroneous and prejudice to the interests of the Revenue. Rarnpyari Devi Saraogi v. ClT [1968] 67 ITR 84(SC) and in Smt. Tara Devi Aggarwal v. CIT[1973] 88ITR 323(SC).
In the instant, the Commissioner noted that the Income-tax Officer passed the order of nil assessment without application of mind. Indeed, the High Court recorded the finding That the income-Tax Officer failed to apply his mind to the case in all perspective and the order passed by him was erroneous. It appears that the resolution passed by the board of the appellant-company was no! placed before the Assessing Officer Thus, there was no material to support the claim of the appellant that the said amount represented compensation for loss of agricultural income. He accepted the entry in the statement of me account filed by the appellant in the absence of any supporting material and without making any inquiry On these facts the conclusion that the order of the Income-lax Officer was erroneous is irresistible We are, therefore, of the opinion that the High Court has rightly held that the exercise of the jurisdiction by the Commissioner under section 263 was justified.
The second contention has to be rejected in view of the finding of fact recorded by the High Court. It was not shown at any stage of the proceedings, That The amount in question was fixed or quantified a& loss of agricultural income and admittedly It is not so round by the Tribunal. The further question whether it will tie agricultural income within the meaning of section 2(1A) of the Act as elucidated by this court in CIT v Raja Benoy Kumar Sahas Roy 11957] 32 ITR 466, does not arise for consideration. it is evident from The order of the High Court that that the findings recorded by the Tribunal that the appellant stopped agricultural operation in November. 1982, and this receipt under consideration did not relate lo any agricultural operation carried on by The appellant, were not questioned before it. Though we do not agree with the High Court that the said amount was paid for breach o' contract as indeed it was paid in modification/relaxation of the terms of the contract, we hold that this High Court is justified m concluding that the said amount was a 'arable receipt under the head ""Income from other sources"".",lb
"Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, J 1 This appeal arises from a judgment of a Division Bench of the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court dated 1 June 2017. In an appeal arising from a decision of the Deputy Commissioner for Employeeâs Compensation, the High Court enhanced the compensation payable under the Employeeâs Compensation Act 1923 1 from Rs 4,33,060 to Rs 8,86,120. The High Court has awarded interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of the accident.

Signature Not Verified In the present proceedings which have been instituted under Article 136 of the Digitally signed by SANJAY KUMAR Date: 2020.02.13 Constitution, notice was issued on 26 July 2019. Since the appellants were 12:36:17 IST Reason:

â1923 Actâ represented by the first appellant in person, this Court, by its order dated 26 July 2019, directed that an amicus curiae be nominated by the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee. Accordingly, Mr S Mahendran, learned counsel, has been nominated as the amicus curiae, whom we have heard in support of the appeal. 3 The appellants are the father, mother, sister and brother of Dinesh Kumar, who died in the course of an accident on 31 January 2008. On the date of the incident, the deceased was 26 years of age and was engaged as a driver of a trailor lorry. While the vehicle was being driven on NH 12 in Kota, Rajasthan, a truck bearing registration No MH 19 Z 1696 came from the opposite direction and dashed against the trailor, resulting in the death of Dinesh Kumar. At the time of the accident, the deceased was in the employment of the first respondent. A claim under the 1923 Act was lodged before the Deputy Commissioner for Employeeâs Compensation, Madurai on 29 April 2013. On 26 March 2014, the claim was allowed by an award in the amount of Rs 4,33,060. The Deputy Commissioner had proceeded ex parte. The appellants filed an appeal2 before the Madras High Court for enhancement of the compensation. 4 The High Court, by its judgment dated 23 November 2015, remanded the proceedings to the Deputy Commissioner for determination afresh. While remanding the proceedings, the High Court noted that though the appellants had filed a salary certificate as Exhibit P5 to establish that the monthly income of the deceased was Rs 32,000, no witness was examined on behalf of the employer to prove the salary certificate. However, acceding to the request of the appellants that they should be furnished with an opportunity to examine the employerâs witness in support of Exhibit CMA (MD) 344 of 2014 P5, the High Court considered it in the interests of justice to remand the proceedings. 5 On remand, the Commissioner for Workmenâs Compensation, Madurai, by an order dated 4 March 2016, maintained the award of compensation in the amount of Rs 4,33,060. Before the Commissioner, on remand, the appellants examined PW2, the owner of the vehicle which was being driven by the deceased. During the course of his evidence, he stated as follows:

âI am the 1st respondent in this case under W.C. Case No.74/2011 is under tail in this court is known to me. I received summons 3 times from the court. For the last two summons, as my own lorries were working in the other states and I also have to go there, I was unable to come and adduce witness for the court summon. The accident platform trailor lorry TN 28 AB 1933 belongs to Sathishkumar. The deceased Dinesh Kumar S/o Sivaraman worked as a driver.
In 2008, (31.1.2008) when going to Pandicheri to Rajasthan Sironi before Kotta town the opposite coming tarras lorry dashed face to face and caused accident. As soon as the accident occurred in the same occurrence place Dineshkumar died. Before accident he worked for about 3 years. He was having proper driving license. He was having license for driving heavy vehicles. The Ex.P.5 monthly pay certificate was issued by me. In it, for deceased Dinesh Kumar I was paying Rs 32,000 per month (including food expenses) but pay of Rs 25,000. The vehicle involved in the accident has been properly insured with 2nd respondent company of M/s Reliance General Insurance Company. At the time of accident, the insurance was in current.â 6 The Commissioner, however, proceeded on the basis that in terms of the notification issued under Section 4(1B) of the 1923 Act, whatever be the monthly pay received by a person, the jurisdiction of the adjudicating authority was subject to a ceiling of Rs 4,000 per month in computing the monthly wages of the employee. Taking the monthly salary at Rs 4,000, the Commissioner applied a multiplicand of 215.28 in terms of Schedule IV (the deceased being 26 years of age) and arrived at a figure of Rs 4,30,560 to which an additional amount of Rs 2,500 was added towards funeral expenses. A total award in the amount of Rs 4,33,060 was decreed as the compensation payable to the appellants.

7 In an appeal filed before the High Court, the Division Bench took note of the fact that in pursuance of the order of remand, the salary of deceased employee had been proved to be Rs 32,000 per month. The High Court noticed that though the accident had taken place on 31 January 2008, the petition for compensation had been lodged on 28 January 2011 and was decided by the Commissioner on 4 March 2016. 8 In the meantime, a notification was issued by the Central Government on 31 May 2010 in the following terms:

âS.O.1258(E) â In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-
section (1B) of Section 4 of the Employee's Compensation Act, 1923, (g of 1923), the Central Government hereby specified, for the purpose of Sub-Section (1) of the said section, the following amount as monthly wages, with effect from the date of publication of this notification in the official gazette, namely â Eight thousand rupees.â 9 The High Court was of the view that having due regard to the fact that the legislation in question is a social welfare legislation, the enhanced income of Rs 8,000 per month should form the basis of the computation. Thus, applying the multiplicand in terms of Schedule IV, the High Court enhanced the compensation to Rs 8,86,120. 10 In appeal before this Court, the learned amicus curiae urged that both the Commissioner and the High Court have erred - the Commissioner having adopted a figure of Rs 4,000 per month and the High Court, Rs 8,000 per month. The learned amicus curiae submitted that in terms of the provisions of Section 4(1)(a) of the 1923 Act, where death has resulted from injury, the compensation payable is an amount equal to fifty per cent of the monthly wages of the deceased employee multiplied by the relevant factor. The relevant factor is specified in Schedule IV and for the deceased who was 26 years old on the date of the accident, the multiplicand would be 215.28. The learned amicus curiae submitted that under sub-section (1B) of Section 4, the Central Government is empowered to issue a notification specifying, for the purposes of sub-section (1), the monthly wages in relation to an employee as it may consider necessary. However, it was submitted that the notification does not impose a cap or ceiling on the monthly wages which form the basis of calculating the compensation due and payable. Where the actual wages of an employee are proved to be in excess of the amount which is specified in the notification, there is no bar in adopting the monthly wages so proved in terms of Section 4(1)(a). The learned counsel buttressed this submission by adverting to Act 45 of 2009, which took effect from 18 January 2010 and deleted the deeming provision in Explanation II to Section

43. Moreover, it was urged by the learned amicus curiae that the method of calculating wages is specified in Section 5. It was urged that clause (a) of Section 5 will be attracted to the present case where the employee was, during a continuous period of not less than twelve months immediately preceding the accident, in the service of the employer.

11 The learned amicus curiae, at a belated stage, sought to distinguish the judgments of this Court in Pratap Narain Singh Deo v Srinivas Sabata4 (âPratap âExplanation II â Where the monthly wages of a workman exceed four thousand rupees, his monthly wages for the purposes of clause(a) and clause(b) shall be deemed to be four thousand rupees only.â (1976) 1 SCC 289 Narain Singhâ) and Kerala State Electricity Board v Valsala K5 (âValsalaâ) in which it was held that the date relevant for the determination of compensation payable under the 1923 Act is the date of the accident and that the benefit of an amendment enhancing the amount of compensation shall not apply to accidents that take place prior to its coming into force. To support this, the amicus curiae relied on the judgments of this Court in New India Assurance Company Ltd. v Neelakandan (âNeelakandanâ),6 and National Insurance Co Ltd. v Mubasir Ahmed7 (âMubasir Ahmedâ).

12 Section 4(1)(a) of the Act contains the following provision:

â4. Amount of compensation.â(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the amount of compensation shall be as follows, namely:â
(a) where death results an amount equal to fifty per cent of the monthly wages of the deceased from the injury employee multiplied by the relevant factor;
or an amount of one lakh and twenty thousand rupees, whichever is more;â 13 The proviso to the above provision stipulates that the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, from time to time, enhance the amount of compensation mentioned in clauses (a) and (b). Clause (b) deals with a case involving permanent total disablement resulting from the injury. The expression ârelevant factorâ is defined in Explanation I to be the factor specified in Schedule IV. Prior to Act 45 of (1999) 8 SCC 254 Civil Appeal Nos. 16904-09 of 1996 (2007) 2 SCC 349 2009, Section 4 contained Explanation II, which was in the following terms:
âExplanation II â Where the monthly wages of a workman exceed four thousand rupees, his monthly wages for the purposes of clause(a) and clause(b) shall be deemed to be four thousand rupees only.â 14 By Act 45 of 2009, which came into force on 18 January 2010, Explanation II came to be deleted. Sub-section (1B) was introduced in Section 4 to read as follows:
â(1-B) The Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify, for the purposes of sub-section (1), such monthly wages in relation to an employee as it may consider necessary.â 15 The question before this Court is whether the benefit of Act 45 of 2009 deleting the deeming provision in Explanation II which capped the monthly wages of an employee at Rs 4,000 would also apply to accidents which took place prior to the coming into force of its provisions i.e. 18 January 2010 and where final adjudication is pending. In assessing whether the Act 45 of 2009 applies retrospectively, it is necessary to analyze the relevant precedents of this Court. In Pratap Narain Singh, the first respondent was in the employment of the appellant and suffered injuries which arose out of and in the course of employment. It was contended that the Commissioner committed an error of law in imposing a penalty on the appellant under Section 4A(3) of the 1923 Act as the compensation payable had not fallen due until it was âsettledâ by the Commissioner under Section 19 of the 1923 Act. Section 4A reads:
â4A. Compensation to be paid when due and penalty for default.- (1) Compensation under section 4 shall be paid as soon as it falls due.
(2) In cases where the employer does not accept the liability for compensation to the extent claimed, he shall be bound to make provisional payment based on the extent of liability which he accepts, and, such payment shall be deposited with the Commissioner or made to the  employee, as the case may be, without prejudice to the right of the employee to make any further claim.
(3) Where any employer is in default in paying the compensation due under the Act within one month from the date it fell due, the Commissioner shall â

(a) Direct that the employer shall, in addition to the amount of the arrears, pay simple interest thereon at the rate of twelve percent per annum or at such higher rate not exceeding the maximum of the lending rates of any scheduled bank as may be specified by the Central Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, on the amount due; and

(b) If, in his opinion, there is no justification for the delay, direct that the employer shall, in addition to the amount of arrears and interest thereon, pay a further sum not exceeding fifty per cent of such amount by way of penaltyâ¦â 16 In terms of Section 4A(1), compensation under Section 4 is payable âas soon as it falls due.â Section 4A(2) contemplates a situation wherein the employer, though accepting the liability to pay compensation to the injured employee, disputes the quantum of compensation payable. In such cases, sub-section (2) enjoins the employer to make a provisional payment based on the extent of accepted liability by depositing it with the Commissioner or by paying it directly to the employee. Section 4A(3) stipulates that where an employer defaults in paying compensation within one month from the date on which it falls due, the Commissioner is empowered to direct the payment of interest as well as an additional amount as arrears for an unjustifiable delay in making payment. Section 19 of the Act reads:

â19. Reference to Commissioners.- (1) If any question arises in any proceedings under this Act as to the liability of any person to pay compensation (including any question as to whether a person injured is or is not an employee or as to the amount or duration of compensation (including any question as to the nature or extent of disablement), the question shall, in default of agreement be settled by a Commissionerâ¦â 17 Section 19 stipulates that any question arising in any proceeding under the Act shall, in the default of an agreement, be settled by the Commissioner. A four judge Bench of this Court rejected the contention urged by the appellant and held that compensation âfalls dueâ on the date of the accident. Consequently, the Commissioner was empowered to impose interest or penalty for the duration prior to the settling of the claim or where there was unjustified delay in making good the payment of compensation. The Court held:
â18â¦The employer therefore became liable to pay the compensation as soon as the aforesaid personal injury was caused to the workman by the accident which admittedly arose out of and in the course of the employment. It is therefore futile to contend that the compensation did not fall due with after the Commissioner's order dated May 6, 1969 under section 19. What the section provides is that if any question arises in any proceeding under the Act as to the liability of any person to pay compensation or as to the amount or duration of the compensation it shall, in default of an agreement, be settled by the Commissioner. There is therefore nothing to justify the argument that the employer's liability to pay compensation under section 3, in respect of the injury, was suspended until after the settlement contemplated by sectionâ¦
19. The appellant was thus liable to pay compensation as soon as the aforesaid personal injury was caused to the appellant, and there is no justification for the argument to the contrary. It was the duty of the appellant, under section 4A(1) of the Act, to pay the compensation at the rate provided by section 4 as soon as the personal injury was caused to the respondent. He failed to do so. What is worse, he did not even make a provisional payment under sub-section (2) of section 4 for, as has been stated, he went to the extent of taking the false pleas that the respondent was a casual contractor and that the accident occurred solely because of his negligence. Then there is the further fact that he paid no heed to the respondent's personal approach for obtaining the compensation. It will be recalled that the respondent was driven to the necessity of making and application to the Commissioner for settling the claim, and even there the appellant raised a frivolous objection as to the jurisdiction of the Commissioner and prevailed on the respondent to file a memorandum of agreement setting the claim for a sum which was so grossly inadequate that it was rejected by the Commissioner. In these facts and circumstances, we have no doubt that the Commissioner was fully justified in making an order for the payment of interest and the penalty.â 18 The Court held that though Section 19 empowered the Commissioner to decide claims or objections under the Act, the obligation to pay compensation to an injured employee was not suspended until the Commissioner settled the amount payable in the case of a dispute between the employer and the employee. Section 4A deals with when the obligation for the payment of compensation as required under the 1923 Act arises. For the purposes of Section 4A of the 1923 Act, the obligation to pay compensation arises on the date of the accident. Where an employer disputes the quantum of compensation payable, it is enjoined to make a provisional payment to the Commissioner or the employee pending the settlement of the claim. This is in order to ensure that an employer does not escape its obligation to make good the payment of compensation or unduly delay its payment on frivolous grounds.",lb
"   JUDGMENT
The appellants are the claimants in O.P.(MV)No.777 of 2014 on the file of the Additional Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Mavelikkara, a claim petition filed under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, claiming compensation on account of the death of one Raveendran Nair, husband of the 1st appellant and father of appellants 2 and 3, in a motor accident which occurred on 26.01.2014, while he was walking along the side of a public road. At the place of accident, he was knocked down by a scooter bearing registration No.KL-30/C-5464, ridden by the 1 st respondent before the Tribunal, owned by the 1 st respondent herein and insured with the 2nd respondent herein. In the accident, he sustained fatal injuries, who succumbed to the injuries on 18.02.2014, while undergoing in-patient treatment. Alleging that the accident occurred due to rash and negligent riding of scooter by its rider, claim petition was filed before the Tribunal, claiming a total compensation of Rs.11,73,000/- under MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) various heads, which was limited to Rs.11,50,000/-, for the purpose of payment of Court Fee.

2. Before the Tribunal, the 1st respondent herein filed written statement admitting the accident; however, denying negligence alleged against the 1st respondent. According to him, the accident occurred due to the negligence on the part of the deceased in crossing the road. The insurer filed written statement admitting the policy coverage of the scooter involved in the accident; however, denying negligence alleged against the rider of that vehicle. The insurer contended that the accident occurred due to the negligence on the part of the deceased. The rider of the scooter was not holding a valid driving licence as on the date of accident, and therefore, there is violation of conditions of policy. The insurer disputed the age, occupation, monthly income, etc. stated in the claim petition and contended that the compensation claimed is highly excessive.

3. Before the Tribunal, Exts.A1 to A13 were marked on the side of the appellants/claimants. Exts.B1 was marked on the side of the respondents. Both sides have not chosen to adduce any oral evidence.

MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C)
4. After considering the pleadings and materials on record, the Tribunal arrived at a conclusion that the accident occurred due to the rash and negligent riding of the scooter by its rider. Since insurance coverage of the said vehicle was not in dispute, the insurer was held liable to indemnify the insured. However, on a finding that, as on the date of accident, the rider of the scooter was not holding a valid driving licence, the insurer was granted recovery right to proceed against the owner, for recovering the amount of compensation paid to the claimants. Under various heads, the Tribunal awarded a total compensation of Rs.6,11,472/- together with interest at the rate 7.5% per annum from the date of petition, i.e., from 25.06.2014, till the date of realisation, with proportionate cost and the insurer was directed to satisfy the award, subject to recovery right.

5. Dissatisfied with the quantum of compensation awarded by the Tribunal under various heads, the appellants/ claimants are before this Court in this appeal.

6. Heard the learned counsel for the appellants/ claimants, the learned counsel for the 1 st respondent owner and also the learned Senior Standing Counsel for the 2 nd respondent MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) insurer.

7. The issue that arises for consideration in this appeal is as to whether the appellants/claimants are entitled for enhancement of the compensation awarded by the Tribunal under various heads. During the course of arguments, learned counsel for the appellants would submit that the challenge made in this appeal can be confined to inadequacy of compensation awarded by the Tribunal under the heads transportation to hospital; extra nourishment; bystanders expense; damage to clothing; dependency compensation; and loss of love and affection to appellants 2 and 3.

8. In Sarla Verma v. Delhi Transport Corporation [(2009) 6 SCC 121] the Apex Court laid down the principles governing determination of quantum of compensation in the case of death in a motor accident. The Apex Court held that, the compensation awarded does not become 'just compensation' merely because the Tribunal considers it to be just. Just compensation is adequate compensation which is fair and equitable, on the facts and circumstances of the case, to make good the loss suffered as a result of the wrong, as far as money MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) can do so, by applying the well settled principles relating to award of compensation. It is not intended to be a bonanza, largesse or source of profit. To have uniformity and consistency, Tribunals should determine compensation in cases of death, by following the well settled steps, namely, ascertaining the multiplicand (annual contribution to the family), the multiplier and calculation of loss of dependency by multiplying the multiplicand by such multiplier.

9. In National Insurance Company Ltd. v. Pranay Sethi [(2017) 16 SCC 680], a Constitution Bench of the Apex Court held that, Section 168 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 deals with the concept of 'just compensation' and the same has to be determined on the foundation of fairness, reasonableness and equitability on acceptable legal standard because such determination can never be in arithmetical exactitude. It can never be perfect. The aim is to achieve an acceptable degree of proximity to arithmetical precision on the basis of materials brought on record in an individual case. The conception of 'just compensation' has to be viewed through the prism of fairness, reasonableness and non-violation of the principle of equitability. In a case of death, the legal heirs of the claimants cannot expect a MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) windfall. Simultaneously, the compensation granted cannot be an apology for compensation. It cannot be a pittance. Though the discretion vested in the Tribunal is quite wide, yet it is obligatory on the part of the Tribunal to be guided by the expression, i.e., just compensation.

10. In the instant case, the compensation awarded by the Tribunal under various heads reads thus;

  9      TOTAL                           11,73,000      6,11,472
                                         (limited to
                                    Rs.11,50,0000)
         11.   The accident occurred on 26.01.2014.                At the time of
 MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C)




accident, the deceased was aged 59 years. It was claimed that, at the time of accident, the deceased was earning a monthly income of Rs.12,000/- as Lab Technician. The document marked as Ext.A12 is the salary certificate, in which the salary of the deceased was shown as Rs.7,000/-. The appellants have not taken steps to prove Ext.A12. The Tribunal fixed the monthly income of the deceased notionally as Rs.5,500/-.

12. In Ramachandrappa v. Manager, Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Company Limited [(2011) 13 SCC 236] the Apex Court reckoned the monthly income of a coolie (manual labourer), who met with a road accident in the year 2004, at the age of 35 years, notionally as Rs.4,500/-. The Apex Court held that, the claimant who was working as a coolie cannot be expected to produce any documentary evidence to substantiate his claim. In the absence of any other evidence contrary to the claim made by the claimant, in the facts of the said case, the Tribunal should have accepted the claim of the claimant. The Apex Court made it clear that, in all cases and in all circumstances, the Tribunal need not accept the claim of the claimant, in the absence of supporting material. It depends on the facts of each case. In a MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) given case, if the claim made is so exorbitant or if the claim made is contrary to ground realities, the Tribunal may not accept the claim and may proceed to determine the possible income by resorting to some guess work, which may include the ground realities prevailing at the relevant point of time.

13. In Syed Sadiq v. Divisional Manager, United India Insurance Co. Ltd. [(2014) 2 SCC 735], taking note of the earlier decision in Ramachandrappa's case (supra), the Apex Court reckoned the monthly income of a vegetable vendor, who met with a road accident in the year 2008, at the age of 24 years, notionally as Rs.6,500/-. In the said decision, the Apex Court held that, a labourer in an unorganised sector doing his own business cannot be expected to produce documents to prove his monthly income. Therefore, there was no reason for the Tribunal and the High Court to ask for evidence to prove his monthly income. Going by the state of economy prevailing at that time and the rising prices in agricultural products, the Apex Court accepted his case that a vegetable vendor is reasonably capable of earning 6,500/- per month.

14. In the absence of any reliable evidence, considering the MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) economic conditions prevailing at the time of accident, i.e., during the year 2014, and taking note of the fixation of notional monthly income by the Apex Court in the decisions referred to supra, the monthly income of the deceased shown in Ext.A12 salary certificate as Rs.7,000/-, cannot be said to be on the higher side, which is taken as his notional monthly income, for the purpose of assessing compensation under various heads.

15. In Pranay Sethi [(2017) 16 SCC 680], a Constitution Bench of the Apex Court held that, the determination of 'just compensation' has to be on the foundation of evidence brought on record as regards the age and income of the deceased and thereafter the apposite multiplier to be applied. The formula relating to multiplier has been clearly stated in Sarla Verma [(2009) 6 SCC 121] and it has been approved in Reshma Kumari v. Madan Mohan [(2013) 9 SCC 65]. The age and income, as stated earlier, have to be established by adducing evidence. The Tribunal and the Courts have to bear in mind that the basic principle lies in pragmatic computation which is in proximity to reality. It is a well accepted norm that money cannot substitute a life lost but an effort has to be made for grant of just MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) compensation having uniformity of approach. There has to be a balance between the two extremes, that is, a windfall and the pittance, a bonanza and the modicum. In such an adjudication, the duty of the Tribunal and the Courts is difficult and hence, an endeavour has been made by this Court for standardization which in its ambit includes addition of future prospects on the proven income at present. As far as future prospects are concerned, there has been standardization keeping in view the principle of certainty, stability and consistency. In Pranay Sethi the Apex Court approved the principle of 'standardisation' so that a specific and certain multiplicand is determined for applying the multiplier on the basis of age.

16. In Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh [(2013) 9 SCC 54], a Three-Judge Bench of the Apex Court held that, in case of self- employed persons also, if the deceased victim is below 40 years, there must be addition of 50% to the actual income of the deceased while computing future prospects. In Munna Lal Jain v. Vipin Kumar Sharma [(2015) 6 SCC 347] another Three-Judge Bench followed the principle stated in Rajesh. In Pranay Sethi, after expressing the opinion that the dicta laid down in Reshma MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) Kumari being earlier in point of time would be a binding precedent and not the decision in Rajesh, the Constitution Bench observed that, in Munna Lal Jain, the Three-Judge Bench should have been guided by the principle stated in Reshma Kumari which has concurred with the view expressed in Sarla Devi or in case of disagreement, it should have been well advised to refer the case to a Larger Bench.

17. In Pranay Sethi [(2017) 16 SCC 680] the Constitution Bench held that, while determining the income, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the income of the deceased towards future prospects, where the deceased had a permanent job and was below the age of 40 years, should be made. The addition should be 30%, if the age of the deceased was between 40 to 50 years. In case the deceased was between the age of 50 to 60 years, the addition should be 15%. Actual salary should be read as actual salary less tax. The Apex Court held further that, in case the deceased was self-employed or on a fixed salary, an addition of 40% of the established income should be the warrant where the deceased was below the age of 40 years. An addition of 25% where the deceased was between the age of 40 to 50 MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) years and 10% where the deceased was between the age of 50 to 60 years should be regarded as the necessary method of computation. The established income means the income minus the tax component.

18. In the instant case, at the time of accident, the deceased was aged 59 years. It was claimed that, at the time of accident, the deceased was earning monthly income as Lab Technician. The Tribunal fixed the monthly income of the deceased notionally as Rs.5,500/-. In the impugned award, relying on the decision of the Apex Court in Pranay Sethi, the Tribunal rightly added 10% of the notional monthly income of the deceased towards future prospects.

19. As already noticed, no reliable materials were placed before the Tribunal to show that, at the time of accident, the deceased had a permanent job. Therefore, the deceased can only be treated as on a fixed salary. In view of the law laid down by the Apex Court in Pranay Sethi, an addition of 10% of the notional monthly income of the deceased, as re-fixed in this appeal considering the economic conditions prevailing at the time of accident and taking note of the fixation of notional monthly MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) income by the Apex Court in Ramachandrappa and in Syed Sadiq referred to supra, can be made towards future prospects, since the deceased was aged between the age of 50 to 60 years.

20. Therefore, for the purpose of re-fixing the compensation under the head loss of dependency, 10% of the monthly income of the deceased notionally re-fixed in this appeal as Rs.7,000/-, i.e., a sum of Rs.700/- (7,000 x 10/100) has to be added towards future prospects. In the result, the monthly income of the deceased, for the purpose of re-fixing the compensation under the head loss of dependency, is reckoned as Rs.7,700/- (7,000 +700).

21. In Sarla Verma [(2009) 6 SCC 121], the Apex Court, after referring to its earlier decisions in Kerala State Road Transport Corporation v. Susamma Thomas [(1994) 2 SCC 176], U.P. State Road Transport Corporation v. Trilok Chandra [(1996) 4 SCC 362] and New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Charlie [(2005) 10 SCC 720] held that the multiplier to be used should be as mentioned in column (4) of the Table in paragraph 40 of the said decision [prepared by applying MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) Susamma Thomas, Trilok Chandra and Charlie], which starts with an operative multiplier of 18 [for the age groups of 15 to 20 and 21 to 25 years], reduced by one unit for every five years, i.e., multiplier of 17 for 26 to 30 years, multiplier of 16 for 31 to 35 years, multiplier of 15 for 36 to 40 years, multiplier of 14 for 41 to 45 years, and multiplier of 13 for 46 to 50 years, then reduced by two units for every five years, i.e., multiplier of 11 for 51 to 55 years, multiplier of 9 for 56 to 60 years, multiplier of 7 for 61 to 65 years and multiplier of 5 for 66 to 70 years.

22. In Pranay Sethi [(2017) 16 SCC 680] the Constitution Bench of the Apex Court held that, as far as the multiplier is concerned, the Claims Tribunal and the Courts shall be guided by Step 2 that finds a place in paragraph 19 of Sarla Verma, read with paragraph 42 of the said judgment.

23. In the instant case, as on the date of accident, the deceased was aged 59 years. In the light of the decisions of the Apex Court in Sarla Verma's case and Pranay Sethi's case referred to supra, the multiplier of 9 applied by the Tribunal is correct and proper.

24. In Sarla Verma v. Delhi Transport Corporation MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) [(2009) 6 SCC 121] the Apex Court, on the question of deduction towards the personal and living expenses of the deceased held that, the personal and living expenses of the deceased should be deducted from his monthly income, to arrive at the contribution to the dependents. Where the deceased was married, the deduction towards personal and living expenses of the deceased should be one-third where the number of dependent family members is 2 to 3; one-fourth where the number of dependent family members is 4 to 6; and one-fifth where the number of dependent family members exceeds 6. In regard to bachelors, normally, 50% is deducted as personal and living expenses, because it is assumed that a bachelor would tend to spend more on himself. Even otherwise, there is also the possibility of his getting married in a short time, in which event the contribution to the parent(s) and siblings is likely to be cut drastically. Further, subject to evidence to the contrary, the father is likely to have his own income and will not be considered as a dependant and the mother alone will be considered as a dependent. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, brothers and sisters will not be considered as dependants, because they MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) will either be independent and earning, or married, or be dependent on the father. Thus even if the deceased is survived by parents and siblings, only the mother would be considered to be a dependant, and 50% would be treated as the personal and living expenses of the bachelor and 50% as the contribution to the family. However, where family of the bachelor is large and dependent on the income of the deceased, as in a case where he has a widowed mother and large number of younger non- earning sisters or brothers, his personal and living expenses may be restricted to one-third and contribution to the family will be taken as two-third.

25. In Reshma Kumari [(2013) 9 SCC 65] a Three-

Judge Bench of the Apex Court reproduced paragraphs 30, 31 and 32 of Sarla Verma and approved the same, in paragraph 38 of the decision, by stating that, the standards fixed in Sarla Verma provide guidance for the appropriate deduction for personal and living expenses. One must bear in mind that the proportion of a man's net earnings that he saves or spends exclusively for the maintenance of others does not form part of his living expenses but what he spends exclusively on himself does. The percentage MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) of deduction on account of personal and living expenses may vary with reference to the number of dependent members in the family and the personal living expenses of the deceased need not exactly correspond to the number of dependants. Therefore, the standards fixed in Sarla Verma on the aspect of deduction for personal living expenses in paras 30, 31 and 32 must ordinarily be followed unless a case for departure in the circumstances noted in the preceding paragraph is made out. In paragraph 43.6 the Apex Court directed that, insofar as deduction for personal and living expenses is concerned, the Tribunals shall ordinarily follow the standards prescribed in paragraphs 30, 31 and 32 of the judgment in Sarla Verma, subject to the observations made in para 38 of Reshma Kumari.

26. In Pranay Sethi [(2017) 16 SCC 680], the Constitution Bench of the Apex Court, after considering the analysis made in Sarla Verma, which was reconsidered in Reshma Kumari, approved the method provided therein by stating that, as far as the guidance provided for appropriate deduction for personal and living expenses is concerned, the Tribunals and Courts should be guided by the conclusion in MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) paragraph 43.6 of Reshma Kumari.

27. In the instant case, at the time of accident, the deceased was aged 59 years with a family consisting of 3 dependants. In the light of the decisions of the Apex Court in Sarla Verma, Reshma Kumari and Pranay Sethi referred to supra, deduction of 1/3rd of the notional monthly income of the deceased towards his personal and living expenses is perfectly legal.

28. Towards loss of dependency, the Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs.4,35,672/- (4,034 x 12 x 9). In this appeal, the monthly income of the deceased has already been re-fixed as Rs.7,000/-. Adding 10% of the notional monthly income of the deceased towards future prospects (7,000 + 700 = 7,700); deducting 1/3rd towards the personal and living expenses of the deceased; and applying the multiplier of 9, the compensation under the head loss of dependency is re-fixed as Rs.5,54,400/- (7,700 x 12 x 9 x 2/3), resulting an additional compensation of Rs.1,18,728/- (5,54,400 - 4,35,672).

29. In the impugned award, towards funeral expenses, the Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs.25,000/-. Towards loss of MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) consortium, the 1st appellant is awarded a sum of Rs.40,000/-. Towards loss of love and affection appellants 2 and 3 are awarded a sum of Rs.75,000/- The Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs.15,000/- under the head loss of estate.

30. In Rajesh [(2013) 9 SCC 54] a Three-Judge Bench of the Apex Court granted Rs.25,000/- towards funeral expenses, Rs.1,00,000/- towards loss of consortium and Rs.1,00,000/- towards loss of care and guidance for minor children.

31. In Pranay Sethi [(2017) 16 SCC 680] the Constitution Bench of the Apex Court held that the head relating to loss of care and guidance for minor children does not exist. Though Rajesh refers to Santosh Devi v. National Insurance Company Limited [(2012) 6 SCC 421], it does not seem to follow the same. The conventional and traditional heads cannot be determined on percentage basis because that would not be an acceptable criterion. Unlike determination of income, the said heads have to be quantified. Any quantification must have a reasonable foundation. There can be no dispute over the fact that price index, fall in bank interest, escalation of rates in many a field have to be noticed. The Court cannot remain oblivious to the MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) same. There has been a thumb rule in this aspect. Otherwise, there will be extreme difficulty in determination of the same and unless the thumb rule is applied, there will be immense variation lacking any kind of consistency as a consequence of which, the orders passed by the Tribunals and Courts are likely to be unguided. Therefore, the reasonable figures on conventional heads, namely, loss of estate, loss of consortium and funeral expenses should be Rs.15,000/-, Rs.40,000/- and Rs.15,000/- respectively. The principle of revisiting the said heads is an acceptable principle. But the revisit should not be fact- centric or quantum-centric. The Apex Court observed that, it would be condign that the amounts that have quantified as above should be enhanced on percentage basis in every three years and the enhancement should be at the rate of 10% in a span of three years, which will bring in consistency in respect of those heads.

32. In Santosh Devi v. Mahaveer Singh [(2018) 9 SCC 146] a Three-Judge Bench of the Apex Court granted compensation on conventional heads, in terms of the figures standardised by the Constitution Bench in the year 2017, in MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) Pranay Sethi, to the wife and children of one Puran Chand, who died in a motor accident, which occurred on 30.12.1992.

33. In Sureshchandra Bagmal Doshi v. New India Assurance Company Limited [(2018) 15 SCC 649] the Apex Court granted the figures on conventional heads standardised by the Constitution Bench in the year 2017, in Pranay Sethi, i.e., Rs.15,000/- as loss of estate; Rs.40,000/- towards loss of consortium; and Rs.15,000/- as funeral expenses to the parents [appellants before the Apex Court], who lost their only daughter in a motor accident which occurred on 16.08.1998. In the said decision, Rs.40,000/- granted in Pranay Sethi towards loss of consortium was granted to the appellants, who are the parents of the deceased, towards loss of love and affection. Paragraphs 1 and 14 of the said decision read thus;

""1. Fate can be cruel. This is a tragic case where the only daughter of a lawyer husband and a doctor wife, who got married early and unfortunately became a widow also at a young age, died in a vehicular accident, which took place on 16.8.1998. The claim of the parents (appellants herein) in respect of this unfortunate demise forms the subject matter of the present appeal.
xxx xxx xxx
14. Now coming to the last aspect, i.e., the conventional MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) heads, in National Insurance Company Ltd. v. Pranay Sethi [(2017) 16 SCC 680], it has been standardised at Rs.15,000 for loss of estate; Rs.40,000 towards loss of consortium (in the present case loss of love and affection) and Rs.15,000 towards funeral expenses. The total amount, thus, would be Rs.70,000, which as per the said judgment is capable of being enhanced @ 10 percent in the span of every three years. However, we are still within the window of three years."" ""underline supplied""
34. In Magma General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Nanu Ram @ Chuhru Ram [(2018) 18 SCC 130], after referring to the decision in Pranay Sethi, the Apex Court held that in legal parlance, 'consortium' is a compendious term which encompasses 'spousal consortium', 'parental consortium' and 'filial consortium'. The right to consortium would include the company, care, help, comfort, guidance, solace and affection of the deceased, which is a loss to his family. With respect to a spouse, it would include sexual relations with the deceased spouse. Spousal consortium is generally defined as rights pertaining to the relationship of a husband-wife which allows compensation to the surviving spouse for loss of 'company, society, co-operation, affection, and aid of the other in every conjugal relation'. Parental consortium is granted to the child upon the premature death of a parent, for MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) loss of 'parental aid, protection, affection, society, discipline, guidance and training'. Filial consortium is the right of the parents to compensation in the case of an accidental death of a child. An accident leading to the death of a child causes great shock and agony to the parents and family of the deceased. The greatest agony for a parent is to lose their child during their lifetime. Children are valued for their love, affection, companionship and their role in the family unit.

35. In Magma General Insurance the Apex Court held that consortium is a special prism reflecting changing norms about the status and worth of actual relationships. Modern jurisdictions world-over have recognised that the value of a child's consortium far exceeds the economic value of the compensation awarded in the case of the death of a child. Most jurisdictions, therefore, permit parents to be awarded compensation under loss of consortium on the death of a child. The amount awarded to the parents is a compensation for loss of the love, affection, care and companionship of the deceased child. The Motor Vehicles Act is a beneficial legislation aimed at providing relief to the victims or their families, in cases of genuine claims. In a case where parents MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) have lost their minor child, or unmarried son or daughter, the parents are entitled to be awarded loss of consortium under the head of filial consortium. Parental Consortium is awarded to children who lose their parents in motor vehicle accidents under the Motor Vehicles Act. The Apex Court held further that, the amount of compensation to be awarded as consortium will be governed by the principles of awarding compensation under 'loss of consortium' as laid down in Pranay Sethi.",lb

1. In the record of proceedings of this Court dated 9th August, 2017 it is noted that learned counsel for the petitioner would like to highlight three issues pertaining to the implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 (for short the Act) and the Scheme framed thereunder. These issues are:

1. Delay in payment of wages and compensation to the beneficiaries under the Act and the Scheme framed thereunder.
2. Reduction in person days and consequent reduction in allocation of funds from the projection made by the State Signature Not Verified Digitally signed by Governments and the Union Territory Administrations. MEENAKSHI KOHLI Date: 2018.05.18 15:49:42 IST Reason:

3. Absence of social audits being conducted.

2. We have heard learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the learned Attorney General in detail in respect of these issues and have also gone through the various affidavits and written submissions.

3. The Act was enacted by Parliament with the objective, inter alia, of enhancing the livelihood security of poor households in rural areas by providing at least one hundred days guaranteed wage employment to every such household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.

4. Section 3(1) of the Act provides that the State Government shall in rural areas (as notified by the Central Government) provide to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work not less than one hundred days of such work in a financial year in accordance with the Scheme made under the Act. Section 3(3) provides that the disbursement of daily wages shall be made on a weekly basis or in any case not later than a fortnight after such work has been done. Section 3 of the Act reads as follows:

â3. Guarantee of rural employment to households. - (1) Save as otherwise provided, the State Government shall, in such rural area in the State as may be notified by the Central Government, provide to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work not less than one hundred days of such work in a financial year in accordance with the Scheme made under this Act. (2) Every person who has done the work given to him under the Scheme shall be entitled to receive wages at the wage rate for each day of work. (3) Save as otherwise provided in this Act, the disbursement of daily wages shall be made on a weekly basis or in any case not later than a fortnight after the date on which such work was done.
 (4) The Central Government or the State Government may, within the limits of its economic capacity and development, make provisions for securing work to every adult member of a household under a Scheme for any period beyond the period guaranteed under sub-section (1), as may be expedient.â

5. Section 4 of the Act provides that to give effect to the provisions of Section 3 thereof every State Government shall frame a Scheme providing not less than one hundred days of guaranteed employment in a financial year to every household in the rural areas covered under the Scheme and whose adult members, by application, volunteer to do unskilled manual work subject to the conditions laid down in the Act and in the Scheme.

6. In terms of Section 4 of the Act a working Scheme has been formulated and is in place and there is no dispute in this regard.

Reduction in person days through approved labour budget and allocation of funds

7. The grievance of the petitioner under this head is succinctly stated and understood by the Union of India in its written submissions of 14th March, 2018 as follows:

(a) âApproved Labour Budgetâ violates the essence of the Act which does not envisage any role for the Central or State Government in altering the labour budget in any form.
(b) The labour budget projections are arrived at through the process  spelt out in Section 14(6) and paragraph 7 of Schedule I of the Act 1 and any reduction of the labour budget goes against the spirit of the Act.

(c) The Central Government has started exercising discretionary powers in deciding how much a State can spend on generating employment.

(d) The generation of the Muster Roll is halted once the State has reached the âApproved Labour Budgetâ.

To appreciate the grievance of the petitioner, it is necessary to refer to a few more provisions of the Act.

Approved labour budget

8. Article 243-G of the Constitution was introduced by the 73rd Amendment Act and this endows the Panchayats with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as institutions of State Government.

9. Section 14 of the Act provides for the appointment of a District Programme Coordinator who is the Chief Executive Officer of the District Panchayat or the Collector or any other district level officer of an appropriate rank as decided by the State Government. The District Programme Coordinator There shall be a systematic, participatory planning exercise at each tier of Panchayat, conducted between August to December month of every year, as per a detailed methodology laid down by the State Government. All works to be executed by the Gram Panchayats shall be identified and placed before the Gram Sabha, and such works which are to be executed by the intermediate Panchayats or other implementing agencies shall be placed before the intermediate or District Panchayats, along with the expected outcomes. is expected to implement the Scheme in the district, in addition to his/her other functions.

10. Section 14(6) of the Act requires the District Programme Coordinator to prepare, in the month of December every year, a labour budget for the next financial year containing the details of anticipated demand for unskilled manual work in the district and the plan for engagement of labourers in the works covered under the Scheme and submit it to the District Panchayat.

11. The step by step requirement (as submitted by the petitioner and in which there is no serious disagreement voiced by the Union of India)2 for identification of works, their finalization, planning and approval of the labour budget under the Act and the Scheme is as follows:

Step 1 Gram Panchayat identifies Section 16(1) of the Act:

works to be taken up in area âThe Gram Panchayat shall be responsible for based on recommendations of identification of the projects in the Gram the Gram/Ward Sabha Sabha area to be taken under a Scheme as per the recommendations of the Gram Sabha and the Ward Sabha and for executing and supervision of works.â Step 2 Gram Panchayat to forward the Section 16(4) of the Act:
works identified by the Gram âThe Gram Panchayat shall forward its Sabha to the Programme proposals for the development projects Officer for scrutiny + including the order of priority between preliminary approval different works to the Programme Officer for scrutiny and preliminary approval prior to the commencement of the year in which it is proposed to be executed.â Step 3 Programme Officer at the Section 15(4) of the Act:
Block level consolidates plans âThe Programme Officer shall prepare a plan received by allGram for the Block under his jurisdiction by Essentially this is only a procedural matter. Too much should not be read into the âdisagreementâ if any.
 Panchayats consolidating the project proposals prepared by the Gram Panchayat and the proposals received from intermediate panchayatsâ Step 4 Block Panchayat to approve Section 16(3)(b) of the Act:

the block level plan prepared âto approve the Block level Plan for by the Programme Officer and forwarding it to the district Panchayat at the forwarding it to the District district level for final approvalâ Panchayat for approval Step 5 District Programme Section 13(3)(a) of the Act:
Coordinator to consolidate allâThe District Programme Coordinator shall âconsolidate the plans prepared by the Blocks Block level plans and submit it to the District Panchayat and project proposals received from implementing agencies for inclusion in the shelf of projects to be approved by the Panchayat at the District levelâ Step 6 District Panchayat finalizes Section 13(2)(a) of the Act:
and approves block-wise works âThe functions of the Panchayats at the district to be taken up under the level shall be-
            Scheme                           (a) To finalise and approve block-wise
                                                 shelf of projects to be taken up under a
                                                 programme under the Schemeâ



It is after the above exercise is complete that the role of the District Programme Coordinator commences.
12. At this stage it is important to notice: (i) The State Government and the Central Government have really no specific role in the formulation of programmes for the benefit of the rural areas and in the expenditure that would be required to carry out the development activities of the Panchayat; (ii) The provisions and steps form the basis of the number of person days of work in a year in each year and the fund requirement; (iii) The requirements made out are anticipatory and indicative.
13. The submission of the petitioner is that, as mandated by the Act, every State Government obtains detailed information from every district and prepares a labour budget which indicates the expenditure anticipated and the person days necessary for implementation of the programmes in the concerned rural area However, the Central Government in the Ministry of Rural Development through an Empowered Committee discusses the annual labour budget with representatives of the State Governments and after such discussions, an âagreed to labour budgetâ (different from the labour budget) is prepared. According to the petitioner, there is no question of having these discussions or an âagreed to labour budgetâ particularly when a detailed assessment has been made by the District Programme Coordinator and the Panchayat and forwarded by the State Government to the Central Government.

14. On the other hand, the view of the Central Government, based on experience, is that some State Governments are not able to fully utilize the proposed labour budget and therefore through discussions, the labour budget is appropriately rationalized to a reasonable figure based on the person days necessary. As mentioned above, this is objected to by the petitioner.

15. The further grievance of the petitioner is that the âagreed to labour budgetâ works as a cap on the expenditure for every financial year and the generation of the Muster Roll is stopped. Therefore, even though there would be unemployed persons willing to do some unskilled manual work but they are prevented from doing so because of an informal cap on expenditure.
16. Essentially, the submission of learned counsel for the petitioner is that first of all there cannot be an âagreed to labour budgetâ for the reason that once the State Government raises a demand for implementation of the Scheme under the Act, the Central Government must release the funds without any reduction in the quantum. The second objection by learned counsel for the petitioner is that if the amount demanded by the State Government is not released there is a very strong possibility of some persons not being able to get employment due to insufficiency of funds and also due to the informal cap on the availability of funds.

17. We are not in agreement with learned counsel on both the submissions. We may mention that we have already dealt with some facets of this issue in our judgment and order of 13th May, 20163 and have nothing to add to that.

18. Rule 5 of The National Employment Guarantee Fund Rules, 2006 provides, inter alia, for release of grants from the National Employment Guarantee Fund (NEGF) to the State Governments and Union Territory Administrations. It prescribes that:

â(1) Before the beginning of each financial year on or before 31st January, all Secretaries of the State Governments and Union Territories concerned with the implementation of the Act and the State Employment Guarantee Scheme shall present their annual work plan and labour budget to the Ministry of Rural Development.
Swaraj Abhiyan (III) v. Union of India & Ors. (2016) 7 SCC 544  (2) The State Governments and Union Territories may also in their annual work plan and labour budget submit proposals for any work other than those specified in Schedule I of the Act.

(3) The Ministry of Rural Development may examine the proposals received by it on or before the 31st of January of each financial year and review the performance of the States and Union Territories with respect to the implementation of the Act and estimate the amount to be released to the State Governments and Union Territory Administrations from the National Fund.

(4) Release of funds to the State Governments and Union Territory Administrations shall be made in accordance with the directions issued by the Ministry of Rural Development from time to time.â [Emphasis supplied by us].

19. It is quite clear that apart from anything else, the Central Government is statutorily empowered to scrutinize and assess the funds to be released to the State Governments and Union Territory Administrations for the purposes of the Act. The final assessment is made by the Empowered Committee in consultation with the State Governments and Union Territory Administrations. Therefore, it is not as if the âagreed to labour budgetâ or the âapproved labour budgetâ is fixed arbitrarily by the Central Government. We do not see anything objectionable in this, more particularly since the process is backed by statutory provisions.

Cap on funds

20. It has been brought on record by the Union of India in its affidavit of 4 th December, 2017 that not only is there no informal cap on the release of funds, but whenever required, necessary funds have been released over and above the âagreed to labour budgetâ. It is stated that in 2015-16 as many as 16 State Governments and Union Territory Administrations had exceeded the âagreed to labour budgetâ and funds had been released. In 2016-17 as many as 20 State Governments and Union Territory Administrations had exceeded the âagreed to labour budgetâ and funds released. The position was similar for 2017-18 with 12 State Governments and Union Territory Administrations exceeding the âagreed to labour budgetâ and funds released.4 This is possible only if there is no cap, informal or otherwise and the generation of the Muster Roll continues.

21. Learned counsel for the petitioner pointed out instances where there had been a shortage of funds released to two States namely Tripura and Telangana.

22. In this regard, it was pointed out by the learned Attorney General that as far as Tripura is concerned, there were some allegations of corruption in the sense of mis-utilization of funds and that was being investigated. It was reported that the funds made available had not been used for the purpose for which they were released. We need not delve into this issue at all and leave it at that.

23. As far as the State of Telangana is concerned it was stated that according to the State functionaries there was 100% utilization by June 2017 itself that is in a period of about two months. We find this difficult to appreciate and in fact we were informed by the learned Attorney General that the factual position is otherwise and it was found that Telangana had not been able to utilize 100% Upto the date of the written submissions, that is, 13th April, 2018 but the data is said to be incomplete funds released as per the âagreed to labour budget.â In the written submissions filed by the Union of India on 13th April, 2018 it is stated as follows:

âHowever, the State has never exceeded 12 crores person days except in FY 2015-16 which was a severe drought year and provision for additional 50 days were granted by Central Government to help the rural poor tide over the impacts of the national calamity. The State after due consultation with the Ministry agreed to 12 crores person days for FY 2017-18. This was 20% more than the approved Labour Budget of FY 2016-17 and due consideration was given to the increased demand for work under the scheme. It is important to mention here that Telangana received the highest ever allocation (Rs.2539.20 Cr) of MGNREGA funds in FY 2017-18. Despite having no paucity of funds in FY 2017- 18, the State could not generate 100% of the agreed to Labour Budget.â",lb

1. The width and amplitude of the expression âcommercial siteâ in Section 2 (5) and Section 81 (1) (q) of the Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963 (for short, â the Actâ), falls for our consideration in these Appeals. Commercial sites are exempted from the purview of the Act. The question whether a rocky land which is used for quarrying purposes can be treated as a âcommercial siteâ and thereby excluded from the applicability of the Act was answered by a learned Single Judge of the Kerala High Court by holding that mere blasting of rocks and conversion into metals does not render the area a âcommercial siteâ.1 Twenty years after the said judgment, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court took a different view. Quarrying was held to be a commercial operation involving the process of manufacture. Hence, it was held that a quarry falls within the ambit of âcommercial siteâ and is exempted from the applicability of the Act.2

2. The Appellant requested environmental clearance for his quarry which was recommended in his favour by the District Expert Appraisal Committee (DEAC) on 25.04.2017. Respondents No.1 and 2 filed a Writ Petition aggrieved by the said recommendation to permit quarry on land which was a plantation site. It is relevant to note that the Appellantâs land was exempted from the realm of the Act as it was a plantation. The objection of Respondent No.1 and 2 was that the Appellant cannot be permitted to use the land for a purpose other than plantation, especially for quarrying operations. After examining the judgments of the High Court in K. Krishnankutty v. State of Kerala and Others (supra) and State of Kerala v. Mohammedali Haji (supra), a learned Single Judge of the High Court of Kerala doubted the correctness of the latter K. Krishnankutty v. State of Kerala and Others. CRP No.1245/1975 State of Kerala v. Mohammedali Haji. (1996) 1 KLT 584 (DB) judgment in State of Kerala v. Mohammedali Haji (supra) and referred the matter to a larger Bench.

3. The Writ Petition filed by Respondent No.1 and 2 was heard by a Full Bench of the Kerala High Court comprising three Judges. The majority opinion was in favour of Respondent No.1 and 2. It was held by the majority that the land which is used for quarrying is not covered by the expression âcommercial siteâ. Therefore, there can be no exemption of such land from the applicability of the Act. The Appellant is aggrieved by the said judgment of the Full Bench of the High Court.

4. Mr. K. V. Vishwanathan, learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant took us through the provisions of the Act including Sections 2(5), 81 and 83 to argue that a quarry is a commercial site, which is exempted under Section 81 (1)

(q) of the Act. He alluded to the statement of objects and reasons to submit that the legislation was made to protect the interests of all stake-holders. He referred to the meaning of the words âcommercial activitiesâ and âbusinessâ to submit that the activity of quarrying is done for profit. Hence, quarrying is a commercial activity. According to him, there can be no distinction between activities done above and below the surface of land for the purpose of deciding whether land is a commercial site or not. He criticized the plurality opinion for erroneously invoking the mischief rule. He commended the judgment of the dissenting Judge for our acceptance. He emphasized that environmental issues are not germane for interpretation of Sections 2 (5) and 81 (1) (q) of the Act.

5. Mr. Pallav Shishodia, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the State of Kerala resisted the submissions made on behalf of the Appellant by submitting that the expression âcommercial siteâ is a term of art and has to be interpreted on the basis of the context in which it is used.

6. Mr. Romy Chacko, learned counsel for the Respondent No.1 and 2 asserted that the Act is a beneficial legislation. When there is a doubt about the meaning of expressions used in such a statute, literal interpretation should be avoided and Courts should adopt the principles of purposive construction. He submitted that the exemption provision should be narrowly construed.

7. Before we consider the submissions made by the learned counsel, it is necessary to examine the provisions of the Act. Section 83 of the Act provides that no person shall be entitled to own or hold or possess under a mortgage, lands in the aggregate in excess of the ceiling area with effect from the date notified by the Government of Kerala in the Gazette. The ceiling area of land is specified in Section 82 of the Act. Lands exempted under Section 81 shall be excluded from computation of the ceiling area as per Section 82 (6) of the Act. Section 81 of the Act is as follows:

81. Exemptions: - (1) the provisions of this Chapter shall not apply to-

a) Lands owned or held by the Government of Kerala or the Government of any other State in India or the Government of India or a local authority [or the Cochin Port Trust] or any other authority which the Government may, in public interest, exempt, by notification in the Gazette, from the provisions of this Chapter.

[Provided that the exemption under this clause shall not apply to lands owned by the Government of Kerala and held by any person under lease whether current or time expired or otherwise.] Explanation I. â âLands owned by the Government of Keralaâ shall, for the purposes of this clause, have the same meaning as âGovernment landsâ under sub- section (1) of Section 2 of the Kerala Government land Assignment Act, 1960 [but lands escheated to the Government and held by tenants entitled to fixity of tenure under Section 13 shall not be deemed to be lands owned by the Government of Kerala;] Explanation II â Lands, the right, title and interest in respect of which have vested in the Government under sub-section (9) of Section 66 or Section 72,  shall not be deemed to be âlands owned by the Government of Keralaâ for the purposes of this clause;] Explanation III - For the purposes of this clause, âother authorityâ shall include a corporation owned or controlled by the Government of Kerala or the Government of any other State in India or the Government of India;]

b) Lands taken under the management of the Court of Wards;

Provided that the exemption under this clause shall cease to apply at the end of three years from the commencement of this Act;

c) Lands comprised of mills, factories or workshops and which are necessary for the use of such mills, factories or workshops;

d) Private forests;

e) Plantations;

f) x x x x

g) x x x x

h) lands mortgaged to the Government, or to a co- operative society (including a co-operative land mortgage bank) registered or deemed to be registered under the Co-operative Societies Act for the time being in force, or to the Kerala Financial Corporation, or to the Kerala Industrial Development Corporation, or to the State Small Industries Corporation, as security for any loan advanced by the Government or by such society or Corporation, so long as the mortgage subsists:

 provided that the exemption under this clause shall cease to apply at the end of three years from the commencement of this Act;

i) lands purchased by the Kerala Co-operative Central Land Mortgage Bank or a Primary Mortgage Bank under Section 18 of the Kerala Co-operative Land Mortgage Banks Act, 1960 [or by the Kerala State Co- operative Bank Ltd., or by a primary agricultural credit co-operative society or by a scheduled bank as defined in the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934] so long as such lands continue in the possession of the bank;

j) Lands purchased by the Kerala Financial Corporation or lands the management of which has been taken over by that Corporation, under Section 32 of the State Financial Corporations Act, 1951, so long as such lands remain in the ownership, or continue under the management, as the case may be, of the said Corporation:

[provided that the exemption under this clause shall not apply in the case of lands the management of which has been taken over by the Corporation on or after the 1st day of April, 1964;]

k) lands belonging to or held by an industrial or commercial undertaking at the commencement of this Act, and set apart for use for the industrial or commercial purpose of the undertaking: Provided that the exemption under this clause shall cease to apply if such land is not actually used for the purpose for which it has been set apart, within such time as the District Collector may, by notice to the undertaking, specify, in that behalf;
l) x x x x

m) house sites, that is to say, sites occupied by dwelling houses and lands, wells, tanks and other structures necessary for the convenient employment of the dwelling houses.

Explanation.- For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that a compound wall shall not be deemed to be a structure necessary for the convenient enjoyment of a dwelling house, if the land on which the dwelling house is situated and enclosed by the compound wall is more than the land necessary for the convenient enjoyment of the dwelling house.

n) x x x x

o) sites of temples, churches, mosques and cemeteries and burial and burning grounds:

p) sites of buildings and including warehouses;

q) commercial sites;

s) lands vested in the Bhoodan Yagna Committee;

t) lands owned or held by-

i. a University establishment by law; or ii. a religious, charitable or educational institutions of a public nature; or iii. a public trust which expression shall include a wakf; Provided that-

 (i) the entire income of such lands is appropriated for the University, institution or trust concerned, and

(ii) where the University, institution or trust come to hold the said lands after the commencement of this Act, the Government have certified previously that such lands are bona fide required for the purposes of the University, institution or trust, as the case may be; and u) lands granted to defence personnel for gallantry.

       (2)       [xxx]
(3)    The Government may if they are satisfied that it is
necessary to do so in the public interest-

(a) on account of any special use to which any land is put; or

(b) on account of any land being bona fide required for the purpose of conversion into plantation or for the extension or preservation of an existing plantation or for any commercial, industrial, educational or charitable purpose, by notification in the Gazette, exempt such land from the provisions of this Chapter, subject to such restrictions and conditions as they may deem fit to impose:

Provided that the land referred to in clause (b) shall be used for the purpose for which it is intended within such time as the Government may specify in that behalf; and, where the land is not so used within the time specified, the exemption shall cease to be in force.]
8. In the present case, the Appellant is claiming exemption on the ground that a quarry would fall within the sweep of âcommercial siteâ as stated in Section 81 (1)

(q). Commercial site is defined in Section 2 (5) as follows:

ââ2(5) âcommercial siteâ means any land (not being a kudiyiruppu or a kudikidappu or karaima) which is used principally for the purposes of any trade, commerce, industry, manufacture or business;ââ
9. The Appellant contended that the definition of âcommercial siteâ is very wide and any land which is principally used for the purpose of trade, commerce, industry, manufacture or business is a commercial site. According to the Appellant, breaking of rock is a manufacturing activity. Quarrying operations involve digging land and breaking of rocks into metal pieces. It was submitted that digging of land and breaking of rock is for a commercial activity and the sale of stones is for the purpose of trade and business. We are afraid that we cannot agree.

10. The dominant legislative intent of the Act is the imposition of ceiling on land holdings and distribution of excess land among landless people.3 Large number of State of Kerala v. K. A. Gangadharan (1977) 1 SCC 208 people have no place of abode in the State of Kerala, which is known as Godâs own country. To provide land to such landless people by taking it from those who possess in excess is the major objective of the Act.4

11. Provisions of a beneficial legislation have to be construed with a purpose-oriented approach. 5 The Act should receive a liberal construction to promote its objects.6 Also, literal construction of the provisions of a beneficial legislation has to be avoided. It is the Courtâs duty to discern the intention of the legislature in making the law. Once such an intention is ascertained, the statute should receive a purposeful or functional interpretation7.

12. In the words of O. Chinnappa Reddy, J. 8, the principles of statutory construction of beneficial legislation are as follows:

4. The principles of statutory construction are well settled. Words occurring in statutes of liberal import such as social welfare legislation and human rights' legislation are not to be put in Procrustean beds or shrunk to Liliputian dimensions. In construing these One Earth One Life & Ors. v. State of Kerala, WP (C) No.28496 of 2016 Regional Executive, Kerala Fishermenâ Welfare Fund Board v. Fancy Food, (1995) 4 SCC 34 Bombay Anand Bhavan Restaurant v. ESI Corporation, (2009) 9 SCC 61 and Union of India v. Prabhakaran Vijay Kumar, (2008) 9 SCC 527 Bharat Singh v. Management of New Delhi Tuberculosis Centre, (1986) 2 SCC 614.
Workmen v. American Express International Banking Corpn. (1985) 4 SCC 71  legislations the imposture of literal construction must be avoided and the prodigality of its misapplication must be recognised and reduced. Judges ought to be more concerned with the âcolourâ, the âcontentâ and the âcontextâ of such statutes (we have borrowed the words from Lord Wilberforce's opinion in Prenn v. Simmonds [(1971) 3 All ER 237] ). In the same opinion Lord Wilberforce pointed out that law is not to be left behind in some island of literal interpretation but is to enquire beyond the language, unisolated from the matrix of facts in which they are set; the law is not to be interpreted purely on internal linguistic considerations. In one of the cases cited before us, that is, Surendra Kumar Verma v. Central Government Industrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court [(1980) 4 SCC 443], we had occasion to say, âSemantic luxuries are misplaced in the interpretation of âbread and butterâ statutes. Welfare statutes must, of necessity, receive a broad interpretation. Where legislation is designed to give relief against certain kinds of mischief, the Court is not to make inroads by making etymological excursions.â

13. While interpreting a statute, the problem or mischief that the statute was designed to remedy should first be identified and then a construction that suppresses the problem and advances the remedy should be adopted. 9 It is settled law that exemption clauses in beneficial or social Indian Performing Rights Society v. Sanjay Dalia, (2015) 10 SCC 161 welfare legislations should be given strict construction 10. It was observed in Shivram A. Shiroor v. Radhabai Shantram Kowshik (supra) that the exclusionary provisions in a beneficial legislation should be construed strictly so as to give a wide amplitude to the principal object of the legislation and to prevent its evasion on deceptive grounds. Similarly, in Minister Administering the Crown Lands Act v. NSW Aboriginal Land Council11, Kirby, J. held that the principle of providing purposive construction to beneficial legislations mandates that exceptions in such legislations should be construed narrowly.",ld

Judgment on: February 28, 2020.

BIBEK CHAUDHURI, J. : -

1. Legal heirs and representatives of original defendant in Title Suit No.87 of 1993 being the substituted defendants are the appellants assailing the judgment and decree of affirmation passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Fast Track, 1st Court, Krishnagar in Title Appeal No.87 of 2003 on 31st August, 2004.

2. The predecessor-in-interest of the substituted plaintiffs (hereafter referred to as the respondents) filed a suit for eviction and recovery of khas possession against the predecessor-in-interest of the appellants in the 1st Court of learned Civil Judge (Junior Division), Krishnagar (at the relevant point of time designated as the Munsif 1st Court) stating, inter alia, that all that peace and parcel of 2 decimal of land situated in Mouza Hatishala and recorded in RS khatian No.1086 being plot No.968/2216 is a portion of entire 5 decimal of land in plot No.968 was originally owned by one Panchu Sardar. The said Panchu Sardar took settlement of the said land from the erstwhile Zamindar. While possessing the said land, the original plaintiff requested the said Panchu Sardar to settle 2 decimal of land in favour of him. Accordingly, the said Panchu Sardar settled 2 decimal of land out of 5 decimal of land in plot No.968 in favour of the plaintiff and accepted rent from him by issuing dakhilas. At the time of RS operation, the said 2 decimal of land was recorded in the name of the original plaintiff in bata plot No.968/2216. After the abolition of intermediary rights over the estate by operation of the West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act, the plaintiff became direct raiyat under the State of West Bengal and he used to possess the said land paying rent to the Government of West Bengal. He also constructed a house over the suit property and has been possessing the same openly, continuously, uninterruptedly and without any disturbance from anybody including the defendant. Accordingly the alternative case of the plaintiff is that he had acquired good and indefeasable title over the suit property by way of adverse possession.

3. It is further stated by the plaintiff that while the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property, the defendant tried to disturb his possession which compelled him to file a suit for permanent injunction against the defendant which was registered as Title Suit No.101 of 1984. However, the plaintiff withdrew the said suit with the leave of the court. Subsequently, on 22nd April, 1990, the defendant forcibly and illegally dispossessed the plaintiff from the suit property. It is further stated by the plaintiff that during LR operation, the suit property was recorded in the name of the plaintiff in draft Record of Rights. However in column No.23 (remark column) of the said draft Record of Rights, the name of the defendant was illegally recorded by the concerned authority. According to the plaintiff such recording of the name of the defendant in column No.23 is absolutely erroneous. It is alleged that the defendant has no right, title and interest over the suit property. He illegally dispossessed the plaintiff sometimes in 1990 and accordingly he filed the suit for eviction, recovery of khas possession of the suit property and other consequential reliefs.

4. The original defendant, namely Bireswar Biswas died during pendency of the suit, his legal heirs and representatives were duly substituted. They contested the suit by filing a written statement. In the written statement the defendants/appellants specifically denied the case of the plaintiff. Specific case of the defendants is that the suit property originally belonged to one Panchu Sardar. His name was recorded in CS Record of Rights. The said Panchu Sardar left India for the then East Pakistan and exchanged his properties with one Aswini Kumar Mondal of village Hatishala. During RS operation the said Aswini Kumar Mondal depended upon the plaintiff who used to manage the properties of the said Aswini Kumar Mondal. The original plaintiff most illegally and surreptitiously recorded 2 decimal of land out of the said 5 decimal of land in plot No.968 by creating a bata plot No.968/2216 in his own name. At the time of partition, Bireswar came to India and began to possess on plot No.969 and suit plot No.968/2216. The original defendant constructed a house thereon and has been possessing the suit property since 1950 with the knowledge of the plaintiff and other villagers. The plot No.968 was recorded in the name of Aswini Kumar Mondal. The original defendant exchanged plot No.968 with his own plot No.921 with the said Aswini Kumar Mondal in the year 1984. Since then the original defendant and his family members being the substituted defendants have been possessing the suit property. The plaintiff has no right, title and interest over the suit property. The plaintiff previously instituted Title Suit No.101 of 1984 in the name of Aswini Kumar Mondal and the original defendant but the said suit was withdrawn therefore the suit filed by the plaintiff was not maintainable. The defendants have also claimed title over the suit property by adverse possession. It is further claimed by the defendants that the story made by the plaintiff in respect of taking settlement of 2 decimal of land out of plot No.968 from Panchu Sardar on payment of yearly rent to Panchu Sardar and after the West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act coming into force the plaintiff paid rent to State of West Bengal are false and concocted for the purpose of depriving the defendants from their ownership and possession over the suit property. So they prayed for dismissal of the suit.

5. On the pleadings of the parties the trial court framed as many as 11 issues. In order to prove their respective cases, one Basudeb Biswas son of original plaintiff deposed as PW1. One Binay Kumar Basu resident of village Hatishala deposed in the trial court on behalf of the plaintiff as PW2. One Anima Biswas, substituted defendant No.1Gha deposed on behalf of the defendants as DW1. DW2, DW3 and DW4 are residents of village Hatishala who supported the case of the defendants.

6. Certain documents were marked exhibits on behalf of both the parties.

7. The learned trial judge on careful perusal of the evidence on record both oral and documentary and having heard the learned Advocates for the parties, decreed the suit on contest without cost.

8. The defendants challenged the said judgment and decree passed in Title Suit No.87 of 1993 in the Court of the learned Additional District Judge, Fast Track, 1st Court at Krishnagar by filing Title Appeal No.87 of 2003. The learned Additional District Judge by his judgment and decree dated 31st August, 2004 dismissed the appeal on contest and thereby affirming the judgment and decree passed by the learned trial court.

9. The aforesaid judgment and decree passed by the First Appellate Court is under challenge in the instant appeal. It is found from the record that the instant appeal came up for hearing under Order XLI Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure before the Hon'ble Division Bench and vide order dated 3rd September, 2007, the Hon'ble Division Bench admitted the appeal formulating the following substantial question of law:-
""Whether or not both the lower courts below erred in not holding that the present suit out of which the present appeal arises is not maintainable in view of the fact that the earlier suit being Title Suit No.101 of 1984 was withdrawn by the respondents in the present appeal without leave of the Court and the present suit has been preferred by the said respondents on the same subject matter and taking into consideration the effect of the provisions under Order 23 Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure.""
10. During the trial of the suit, certified copy of the plaint of Title Suit No.101 of 1984 filed by the original plaintiff of Title Suit No.87 of 1993 out of which the present appeal arises has been marked as Exhibit-D at the instance of the present appellants. It is ascertained from the said exhibit that Title Suit No.101 of 1984 was filed against the predecessor-in- interest of the present appellants as well as Sri. Aswini Kumar Mondal, the original owner of plot No.968 who got title over the suit property by exchange of property with Panchu Sardar after partition. In the said suit it is alleged that the original defendant of the Title Suit No.87 of 1993 was the step-brother of the plaintiff. The said defendant taking advantage of the Record of Rights in respect of 03 decimal of land in plot No.968 with 2 rooms thereon in the name of the defendant No.2 executed a registered deed of exchange on 6th April, 1984 with the said defendant No.2 Aswini Kumar Mondal and exchanged the said 03 decimal of land in plot No.968 with another land measuring about 28 decimal belonging to the defendant No.1. Taking advantage of the said deed of exchange, the defendant was raising obstruction in peaceful enjoyment of the plaintiff's property measuring about 02 decimal of land in plot No.968/2216. Therefore, the plaintiff prayed for declaration of title in respect of the said plot No. 968/2216 and permanent injunction against the defendant.

11. Plaintiff filed an application on 22nd December, 1987 in Title Suit No.101 of 1984 stating, inter alia, that he and the original defendant are brothers by relation. The plaintiff was suffering from various illness at the relevant point of time and he does not want to proceed with the said suit accordingly he prayed for unconditional withdrawal of the suit.

12. From the judgment of the trial court it is found that Title Suit No.101 of 1984 was disposed of as withdrawn.

13. Mr. Milon Bhattacharyya, learned Senior Counsel on behalf of the appellants at the outset draws my attention to the various provisions of Order XXIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It is submitted by Mr. Bhattacharyya that Rule 1 of Order XXIII speaks of withdrawal of suit or abandonment of part of claim. Rule 1 of Order 23 refers to two types of cases, viz, (i) where the plaintiff withdraws a suit or part of a claim with the permission of the Court to bring a fresh suit on the same subject matter, and (ii) where the plaintiff withdraws a suit without permission of the Court. He further submits that withdrawal of suit without taking leave to sue fresh on the same cause of action bars a fresh suit on the selfsame subject matter. The plaintiff would be debarred from filing a fresh suit on the selfsame cause of action on which the earlier suit was filed and withdrawn without leave of the Court. Indisputably, the original plaintiff instituted Title Suit No.101 of 1984 and the said suit was withdrawn in the year 1987. The earlier suit was for declaration of title and permanent injunction. As no leave was taken to institute the subsequent suit being Title Suit No.87 of 1993, the subsequent suit is barred under Sub-rule 4 of Rule 1 of Order XXIII of the Code of Civil Procedure.

14. Mr. Bhattacharyya, learned Senior Counsel on behalf of the appellants has substantiated his argument contending, inter alia, that an order of withdrawal of an earlier suit between the same parties operates as res judicata in respect of the subsequent suit and the subsequent suit is barred under Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In support of his contention, Mr. Bhattacharyya has placed his reliance on the following decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court:-

(1) Syed Mohd. Salie Labbai (Dead) by L. Rs. & Ors vs. Mohd. Hanifa (Dead) by L. Rs. & Ors : AIR 1976 SC 1569.
(2) Sarguja Transport Service vs. State Transport Appellate Tribunal, Gwalior & Ors : AIR 1987 SC 88. (3) H.N. Jagannath & Ors. vs. State of Karnataka & Ors :
(2018) 11 SCC 104.
(4) Mohhamed Khan (Dead) through Legal Representative vs. Ibrahim Khan & Anr. : (2018) 14 SCC 495. (5) Anil Kumar Singh vs. Vijay Pal Singh & Ors.: (2018) 12 SCC 584.
15. In Sarguja Transport Service (supra) the question that came up for consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Court is whether a petitioner after withdrawing a writ petition filed by him in the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India without permission to institute a fresh petition can file a fresh writ petition in the High Court under that Article. The Hon'ble Supreme Court was pleased to hold that the principle underlying Rule 1 of Order XXIII of the Code of Civil Procedure should be extended in the interests of Administration of Justice to cases of withdrawal of writ petition also, not on the ground of res judicata but on the ground of public policy. It would also discourage the litigant from indulging in bench-hunting tactics. In any event there is no justifiable reason in such a case to permit a petitioner to invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution once again. While the withdrawal of a writ petition filed in a High Court without permission to file a fresh writ petition may not bar other remedies like a suit or a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India since such withdrawal does not amount to res judicata, the remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution of India should be deemed to have been abandoned by the petitioner in respect of the cause of action relied on in the writ petition when he withdraws it without such permission. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has culled out the only exception to this rule in respect of a writ in the nature of habeas corpus or enforcement of fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.

16. In Paragraph 14 of the H.N. Jagannath & Ors. (supra) it is observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as hereunder:-
""Whenever the suits are withdrawn, respondent no. 4 has not sought any liberty to approach the civil court once again. Thus, it was not open for respondent no. 4 to approach the civil court repeatedly for the very reliefs. Consistently, the civil court on three occasions has negative the contention of the appellant.""
17. Factual background of Anil Kumar Singh (supra), in my humble view, is required to be stated for proper appreciation. The plaintiff instituted a suit for permanent injunction restraining respondent No.1 from interfering in his possession over portion of the suit land. In the said suit the trial court granted ex parte temporary injunction. During the pendency of the suit, parties claimed to have entered into a compromise and the respondent No.1 agreed not to interfere in the appellant's possession. Subsequently, the appellant (plaintiff) filed an application to withdraw the suit under Order Rule 1. The trial court disposed of the said application and the suit was dismissed as withdrawn. The respondent No.1 preferred a revision against the said order before the learned Additional District Judge. The revisional application was dismissed. The respondent No.1 moved the Allahabad High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. The High Court allowed the respondent's petition to set aside the orders of the learned Additional District Judge and the trial court and also directed the appellant (plaintiff) to place respondent No.1 (defendant No.1) in possession of the suit property. In paragraph 25 of the said decision the Hon'ble Supreme Court held, ""However, when the plaintiff applies for withdrawal of the suit along with a prayer to grant him permission to file a fresh suit on the same subject matter as provided in sub-rule (3) of Rule 1 then, in such event, the defendant can object to such prayer made by the plaintiff. In such event, it is for the Court to decide as to whether the permission to seek withdrawal of the suit should be granted to the plaintiff and, if so, on what terms as provided in sub- rule (3) of Rule 1.

18. Mr. Bhattacharyya draws an impression by referring to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mohhamed Khan (supra) that the order of withdrawal of the earlier suit filed by the original plaintiff being Title Suit No.101 of 1984 without obtaining leave to file a fresh suit on the selfsame cause of action operates as res-judicata under Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

19. I am, however not in a position to accept the above submission made by the learned Senior Counsel on behalf of the appellants. It is needless to say that Order XXIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure deals with withdrawal of suits. It enacts that where the plaintiff withdraws the suit abandons his claim without leave of the court, he will be precluded from instituting a fresh suit in respect of the same cause of action. The distinction between res judicata and withdrawal of suit lies in the fact that while in the former, the mater is heard and finally decided between the parties, in the latter the plaintiff himself withdraws or abandons his claim before it is adjudicated on merits. The plea of res judicata to be specifically pleaded and proved, and if a party fails to raise such plea it will be deemed to have been waived. Such plea cannot be raised for the first time at the stage of appeal or for the first time in appeal before this Court. This has been held in ITC Limited vs. Commissioner Central Excise, New Delhi reported in AIR 2005 SC 1370. The doctrine of res judicata operates against both the parties to the suit and not against one alone. On the contrary the order of withdrawal of a suit under Order 23 Rule 1 operates as against the plaintiff alone. It is necessary to mention that before a plea of res judicata can be given effect, the following conditions must be proved - (1) that the litigating parties must be the same. (2) That the subject matter of the suit also must be identical. (3) That the matter must be finally decided between the parties and (4) that the suit must be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction.

20. Withdrawal of a suit under Order XXIII operates completely in a different field and does not decide any issue of either fact or law finally. If the suit is found to be defective or claim is either settled or legally barred, the plaintiff can pray for withdrawal of suit or abandonment of part of claim during the pendency of the suit before it is finally decided. Therefore, in case of withdrawal of a suit there is no finality of the dispute between the parties. As a matter of public policy, the plaintiff is however debarred from filing a fresh suit on the selfsame cause of action if the suit is withdrawn under Order XXIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Therefore, the principle of res judicata is not applicable in a suit withdrawn under Order 23 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
21. Mr. Bhattacharyya further submits that the learned First Court of Appeal failed to consider that in the earlier suit (T.S 101 of 1984), the plaintiff prayed for declaration of his title over the suit property and permanent injunction. In the subsequent suit the plaintiff prayed for declaration of title and recovery of khas possession in respect of the suit property. The cause of action in both the suits are same and identical. The learned First Appellate Court failed to appreciate the evidence on record on the issue as to whether Title Suit No.87 of 1993 is barred under Order 23 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Therefore, the judgment delivered by the First Appellate Court suffers from perversity. Under such circumstances, the High Court can interfere the finding of the First Appellate Court as it constitute the substantial question of law in support of his contention Mr. Bhattacharyya refers to a decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Marai Colaco & Anr. vs. Alba Flora Herminda D'Souza & Ors. reported in (2008) 5 SCC 268. On the selfsame issue he also refers to State of Rajasthan & Ors. vs. Shiv Dayal & Anr. reported in (2019) 5 WBLR (SC) 276 and submits that even concurrent finding of fact by the learned trial court and the learned First Appellate Court can be assailed in second appeal on the ground that it was recorded de hors the pleadings or it was based on no evidence or it was recorded against any provision of law and lastly, the decision is one which no judge acting judicially could reasonably has reached.

22. Thus, Mr. Bhattacharyya concludes that both the Courts below substantially erred in law in holding Title Suit No.87 of 1993 maintainable without considering the fact that the earlier suit between the parties on same cause of action was withdrawn under Order 23 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

23. Mr. Amal Krishna Saha, learned Advocate for the respondents on the other hand submits that Title Suit No.87 of 1993 was filed by the original plaintiff alleging, inter alia, that predecessor-in-interest of the present appellants dispossessed him from the suit property on 22nd April, 1990. The Title Suit No.101 of 1984 was filed by the plaintiff alleging, inter alia, that taking advantage of an erroneous recording in LR Record of Rights in column No.23 that the original defendant was in adverse possession (Jor dang) in respect of plot No.968/2216, the original defendant tried to disturb possession of the plaintiff over the suit property. Thus, the cause of action in Title Suit No.101 of 1984 arose when the plaintiff was threatened to be dispossessed. The said suit was withdrawn in the year 1987 after an amicable settlement was arrived at by and between the original plaintiff and the original defendant. However it is alleged by the plaintiff that he was dispossessed from the suit property. He claimed ownership over the suit property on the basis of patta issued by one Panchu Sardar, the original owner of the suit property. After obtaining patta the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property on payment of rent to the superior owner. After the West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act coming into force, the plaintiff's name was recorded in respect of the suit property as raiyat. He went on possessing the suit property by paying taxes to the State of West Bengal. All these documents were marked exhibits. The question of possession and ownership being question of fact, cannot be agitated in the second appeal. Moreover, no substantial questions of law on perversity of the judgment for non consideration of material evidence or finding of fact without pleadings or evidence or misreading of evidence on record is alleged in the instant appeal by the appellants. The appeal was admitted only on the solitary ground as to whether the Title Suit No.87 of 1993 is barred under Order 23 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Therefore, this Court is under obligation to consider only the substantial question of law formulated by the Division Bench of this Court.

24. It is submitted by Mr. Saha, learned Advocate for the respondents that the cause of action in this suit arose on 22nd April, 1990 when the plaintiff was dispossessed from the suit property. Therefore, the cause of action of Title Suit No.101 of 1984 and the Title Suit No.87 of 1993 is not identical but completely distinct and separate. Thus, the suit is not barred under Order XXIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Having heard the learned Advocates for the appellants and the respondent and on perusal of the entire materials on record and having regard to the substantial question of law, I am of the view that the provision of Order 23 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure is required to be quoted for proper adjudication of the substantial question of law formulated by the Division Bench of this Court:-

Order XXIII R.1. Withdrawal of suit or abandonment of part of claim (1) At any time after the institution of a suit, the plaintiff may as against all or any of the defendants abandon his suit or abandon a part of his claim: Provided that where the plaintiff is a minor or other person to whom the provisions contained in rules 1 to 14 of Order XXXII extend, neither the suit nor any part of the claim shall be abandoned without the leave of the Court.
(2) An application for leave under the proviso to sub-rule (1) shall be accompanied by an affidavit of the next friend and also, if the minor or such other person is represented by a pleader, by a certificate of the pleader to the effect that the abandonment proposed is, in his opinion, for the benefit of the minor or such other person. (3) Where the court is satisfied-
(a) that a suit must fail by reason of some formal defect, or

(b) that there are sufficient grounds for allowing the plaintiff to institute a fresh suit for the subject-matter of a suit or part of a claim, it may, no such terms as it thinks fit, grant the plaintiff permission to withdraw from such suit or such part of the claim with liberty to institute a fresh suit in respect of the subject- matter of such suit or such part of the claim.

(4) Where the plaintiff-

(a) abandons any suit or part of claim under sub-rule (1), or
(b) withdraws from a suit or part of a claim without the permission referred to in sub-rule (3), he shall be liable for such costs as the court may award and shall be precluded from instituting any fresh suit in respect of such subject-matter or such part of the claim.

(6) Nothing in this rule shall be deemed to authorise the court to permit one of several plaintiffs to abandon a suit or part of a claim under sub-rule (1), or to withdraw, under sub-rule (3), any suit or part of a claim, without the consent of the other plaintiffs.

25. The words ""subject matter"" used in Order 23 Rule 1 (4) means the bundle of facts which have to be proved in order to entitle the plaintiff to claim relief by him. Where the cause of action and relief claimed in the second suit are not the same as the cause of action and relief claimed in the first suit, the second suit cannot be considered to have been brought in respect of the same subject matter as the first suit. This has been held by the Supreme Court in Vallabh Das vs. Dr. Madanlal & Ors reported in AIR 1970 SC 987. Mr. Saha rightly has pointed out that at the time of filing of Title Suit No.101 of 1984 the plaintiff had no occasion to pray for recovery of possession as he alleged that he was dispossessed from the suit property on 22nd April, 1990 and he prayed for recovery of possession in this suit. I have carefully considered the written statement filed by the appellants as defendants and specially paragraph 18 and 19 of the said written statement and I have not found any specific denial of such allegation made by the plaintiff with regard to his dispossession from the suit property. Therefore, the cause of action of the earlier suit and the cause of action of Title Suit No.87 of 1993 are altogether distinct, different and separate. In view of such circumstances, it cannot be held that both the earlier suit and Title Suit No.87 of 1993 were filed on selfsame ""subject matter"" by the plaintiff. In view of such circumstances, I have no other alternative but to hold that the suit is not barred under Order 23 Rule 1(4) of the Code of Civil Procedure.

26. The argument advanced by the learned Senior Counsel on behalf of the appellants on applicability of Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not hold good in view of my observation made hereinabove.

27. I have carefully perused the judgment of both the Courts below and I do not find the same to be bad on the ground of perversity. For the reasons stated above, I do not find any substantial question of law involved in the instant appeal and the substantial question of law formulated by the Division Bench of this Court is answered in the negative.

28. As a result the instant second appeal is dismissed on contest, however without cost.

29. Judgment and decree passed in Title Appeal No.87 of 2003 by the learned Additional District Judge, Fast Track 1st Court, Krishnagar affirming the judgment and decree dated 30th August, 2003 passed in Title Suit No.87 of 1993 by the learned Civil Judge (Junior Division), 1st Court at Krishnagar is affirmed.

30. The appellants are directed to deliver peaceful possession of the suit property within 60 days from the date of receipt of lower court record, failing which the respondents are at liberty to put the decree drawn by the trial court in execution.",ld
"Leave granted.

2. Heard the learned counsel for the parties.

3. By way of present appeal, the appellants challenge the judgment and order dated 1.12.2014, passed by the Signature Not Verified single judge of the High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore in Digitally signed by CHARANJEET KAUR Date: 2020.02.14 Civil Miscellaneous Petition No. 167 of 2013 whereby, 18:15:23 IST Reason:

Justice L. Sreenivasa Reddy, former judge of the High Court of Karnataka, was appointed as Arbitrator to conduct arbitration proceedings at the Arbitration Centre, Bangalore, as per the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as âthe Arbitration Actâ) read with the Arbitration Central Rules.

4. The facts, in brief, giving rise to the present appeal are as under:

5. The appellant No.1 is a registered Charitable Trust. Rest of the appellants are Trustees of the appellant No.1 â Trust. The appellant No.1 â Trust desired to develop the land owned by it and construct a multiÂ­purpose community hall with office complex.

6. As such, the respondent No.1 offered to develop the said property and also to renovate the Samadhi of the founder of the Trust existing on the said piece of land. Negotiations were held between the appellant No.1 â Trust and the respondent No.1.

7. As an outcome of the negotiations, a lease deed was executed between the appellant No.1 Â­Trust and the respondent No.1 â lessee for a period of 38 years. As per the said lease deed, the respondent No.1 â lessee was required to pay an amount of Rs.55,00,000/Â­ (Rupees Fifty five lakh only) as an interest free deposit, which was to be refunded to it at the end of the period of 38 years, if the lease was not extended between the parties. As per the terms of the said lease deed, a certain monthly ground rent was also required to be paid by the respondent No.1 â lessee to the appellant No.1 Â­Trust. As per the said lease deed, the respondent No.1 â lessee was to construct a multiÂ­purpose auditorium with minimum seating capacity of one thousand persons. The said auditorium was to be used for marriages, etc. together with dining hall, kitchen, guest rooms, etc. The respondent No.1 â lessee had also undertaken to obtain vacant possession of property mentioned in Schedule âBâ subject to all coÂ­operations being extended to it, by the lessor for ejectment of the existing tenants of the lessor. The said lease deed was executed on 31.5.1996 on the basis of the resolution of the appellant No.1 â Trust dated 30.4.1996.

8. A subsequent lease deed dated 12.3.1997 came to be executed between the appellant No.1 and the respondent No.1. Most of the terms and conditions in the subsequent/fresh lease deed dated 12.3.1997 are identical with the terms and conditions as are found in the first lease deed dated 31.5.1996.

9. It appears, that during the period between 1997 till 2000, there was not much progress in the development of the said project. It further appears that in the year 2008 certain reÂ­negotiations took place between the appellants and the respondents. However, the same failed to materialize. It is the case of the appellants, that except paying initial amount of Rs.25 lakhs towards the security deposit, the balance amount towards the security deposit was not paid by the respondents. It was also the case of the appellants that the respondents were trying to interfere with the possession of the trust property in collusion with one of the trustees. In this background, the appellant â Trust filed Original Suit being O.S. No.8952 of 2010 before the City Civil Court at Bangalore. In the said suit, it was also contended on behalf of the appellants that the respondent No.1 â lessee had also desecrated the Samadhi of the founder of the Trust and had damaged part of it. It was further contended that, the respondent No.1 â lessee, in collusion with the respondent No.4, was trying to get a fresh lease deed executed illegally. The following prayers were made in the said suit:

âa. Decree of permanent injunction restraining the Defendants 1 to 3, their agents, servants from interfering with the peaceful possession and enjoyment of the 1st Plaintiff Trust over the A schedule property.

b. Permanent injunction restraining the Defendants 1 to 4 from entering into, executing or registering any lease deed or other document transaction concerning the A schedule property or any portion of it.


      c.     Decree granting of costs of the case
             and such other relief/reliefs as the
             Court   may     deem   fit   in  the
             circumstances.â


10. The City Civil Court at Bangalore, granted an interim order by directing maintaining of status quo over the Schedule property in the said suit. The suit was contested by the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 by filing written statement.

11. Respondent Nos. 1 and 2, after participating in the suit proceedings for almost a period of about two years and three months, issued a notice to the appellants on 6.9.2013 thereby, invoking arbitration clause in the lease deed dated 31.5.1996 and 12.3.1997. On 11.10.2013, the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 filed a petition under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration Act before the High Court of Karnataka. On being served with the notice, the appellants entered their appearance and filed their statement of objections on 2.6.2014 thereby, praying for dismissal of the petition on various grounds.

12. Since it was the basic contention of the appellants, that the lease deed dated 12.3.1997 being insufficiently stamped had to be mandatorily impounded under Section 33 of the Karnataka Stamp Act, 1957 and it could not be relied upon unless proper duty and penalty was paid, the single judge of the Karnataka High Court referred the matter to the Registrar (Judicial) for determination of the said issue. The Registrar (Judicial) of the High Court of Karnataka by a detailed report dated 25.9.2014 held, that the document in question was lease deed and not an agreement to lease and therefore, directed the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 to pay deficit stamp duty and penalty of Rs. 1,01,56,388 /Â­ (Rupees One crore One lakh FiftyÂ­Six thousand Three hundred and EightyÂ­Eight only).

13. The respondent Nos. 1 and 2 filed their objections to the report of the Registrar (Judicial). The High Court of Karnataka without consideration of the report of the Registrar (Judicial) passed the impugned order thereby, allowing the petition filed by the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 and invoking power under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration Act, appointed an Arbitrator to decide the dispute between the appellants and the respondents. Being aggrieved thereby, the appellants are before this Court.

14. We have heard Shri Nikhil Nayyar, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants and Shri Balaji Srinivasan, learned counsel appearing for the respondents.

15. Shri Nikhil Nayyar, learned Senior Counsel, submits, that though clause 36 of the lease deed dated 12.3.1997 provides for arbitration between the parties, since the said lease deed was insufficiently stamped, the same could not have been relied upon by the High Court for appointing Arbitrator. It is further submitted, that the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 had failed to take any steps in furtherance of the lease deed dated 12.3.1997 and belatedly, after a period of almost 16 years and only when the suit filed by the appellants was in the final stages, had invoked the arbitration clause. Learned Senior Counsel submits, that as a matter of fact, the suit filed by the appellants already stands decreed by a judgment and decree dated 2.3.2015.

16. Shri Balaji Srinivasan, learned counsel appearing for the respondents, on the contrary submits, that the agreement was in effect, an agreement to lease the property which was required to be stamped only after all the tenants were evicted and the permission to start the construction was granted by the Corporation. It is submitted, that the respondents were, all the while, trying to negotiate with the various tenants and as such, the High Court was right in holding, that the agreement was for developing the property immediately after the property was made vacant by evicting the tenants.

17. It will be apposite to reproduce Sections 33 and 34 of the Karnataka Stamp Act, 1957, which are as under:

â33. Examination and impounding of instruments.Â­ (1) Every person having by law or consent of parties authority to receive evidence, and every person in charge of a public office, except an officer of police, before whom any instrument, chargeable in his opinion, with duty, is produced or comes in the performance of his functions, shall, if it appears to him that such instrument is not duly stamped, impound the same.

(2) For that purpose every such person shall examine every instrument so chargeable and so produced or coming before him, in order to ascertain whether it is stamped with a stamp of the value and description required by the law in force in the State of Karnataka when such instrument was executed or first executed: Provided that,â

(a) nothing herein contained shall be deemed to require any Magistrate or Judge of a Criminal Court to examine or impound, if he does not think fit so to do, any instrument coming before him in the course of any proceeding other than a proceeding under Chapter XII or Chapter XXXVI of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898;

(b) in the case of a Judge of the High Court, the duty of examining and impounding any instrument under this section may be delegated to such officer as the Court appoints in this behalf.

(3) For the purposes of this section, in cases of doubt, the Government may determine,â

(a) what offices shall be deemed to be public offices; and

(b) who shall be deemed to be persons in charge of public offices.

34. Instruments not duly stamped inadmissible in evidence, etc.Â­ No instrument chargeable with duty shall be admitted in evidence for any purpose by any person having by law or consent of parties authority to receive evidence, or shall be acted upon, registered or authenticated by any such person or by any public officer, unless such instrument is duly stamped:

Provided that,â

(a) any such instrument not being an instrument chargeable with a duty not exceeding fifteen naye paise only, or a mortgage of crop Article 35 (a) of the Schedule chargeable under clauses (a) and (b) of section 3 with a duty of twentyÂ­five naye paise shall, subject to all just exceptions, be admitted in evidence on payment of the duty with which the same is chargeable, or, in the case of an instrument insufficiently stamped, or the amount required to make up such duty, together with a penalty of five rupees, or, when ten times the amount of the proper duty or deficient portion thereof exceeds five rupees, of a sum equal to ten times such duty or portion;

(b) where a contract or agreement of any kind is effected by correspondence consisting of two or more letters and any one of the letters bears the proper stamp, the contract or agreement shall be deemed to be duly stamped;

(c) nothing herein contained shall prevent the admission of any instrument in evidence in any proceeding in a Criminal Court, other than a proceeding under Chapter XII or Chapter XXXVI of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898;

(d) nothing herein contained shall prevent the admission of any instrument in any Court when such instrument has been executed by or on behalf of the Government, or where it bears the certificate of the Deputy Commissioner as provided by section 32 or any other provision of this Act and such certificate has not been revised in exercise of the powers conferred by the provisions of Chapter VI.â

18. Admittedly, both the lease deeds are neither registered nor sufficiently stamped as required under the Karnataka Stamp Act, 1957. Admittedly, the Registrar (Judicial) of the High Court of Karnataka had submitted a report to the High Court pointing out, that the document of 1997 executed/entered into between the parties was a lease deed and not an agreement to lease and passed an order directing the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 to pay deficit stamp duty and penalty of Rs. 1,01,56,388 /Â­ (Rupees One crore One lakh FiftyÂ­Six thousand Three hundred and EightyÂ­ Eight only). It is also an admitted fact, that the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 have not complied with the said directions and have not paid the deficit stamp duty and penalty. In this background, a question that would arise for consideration is, as to whether clause 36 in the lease deed dated 12.3.1997 could be acted upon to enforce the arbitration clause contained therein.

19. The issue is no longer res integra. This Court in the case of SMS Tea Estates Private Limited vs. Chandmari Tea Company Private Limited1 had occasion to consider the provisions which are in pari materia with the provisions 1 (2011) 14 SCC 66 of the Karnataka Stamp Act, 1957. The relevant paragraphs are as under:

â17. What if an arbitration agreement is conÂ­ tained in an unregistered (but compulsorily registerable) instrument which is not duly stamped? To find an answer, it may be necesÂ­ sary to refer to the provisions of the Stamp Act, 1899 (âthe Stamp Actâ, for short). Section 33 of the Stamp Act relates to examination and impounding of instruments. The relevant portion thereof is extracted below:
â33.Examination and impounding of inÂ­ struments.â(1) Every person having by law or consent of parties authority to receive eviÂ­ dence, and every person in charge of a public office, except an officer of police, before whom any instrument, chargeable, in his opinion, with duty, is produced or comes in the perÂ­ formance of his functions, shall, if it appears to him that such instrument is not duly stamped, impound the same.
(2) For that purpose every such person shall examine every instrument so chargeable and so produced or coming before him, in order to ascertain whether it is stamped with a stamp of the value and description required by the law in force in India when such instrument was executed or first executed:â
18. Section 35 of the Stamp Act provides that instruments not duly stamped are inadmissiÂ­ ble in evidence and cannot be acted upon.
The relevant portion of the said section is exÂ­ tracted below:

â35.Instruments not duly stamped inadÂ­ missible in evidence, etc.âNo instrument chargeable with duty shall be admitted in eviÂ­ dence for any purpose by any person having by law or consent of parties authority to reÂ­ ceive evidence, or shall be acted upon, regisÂ­ tered or authenticated by any such person or by any public officer, unless such instrument is duly stamped:

Provided thatâ

(a) any such instrument shall be admitted in evidence on payment of the duty with which the same is chargeable or, in the case of an instrument insufficiently stamped, of the amount required to make up such duty, toÂ­ gether with a penalty of five rupees, or, when ten times the amount of the proper duty or deficient portion thereof exceeds five rupees, of a sum equal to ten times such duty or porÂ­ tion;â

19. Having regard to Section 35 of the Stamp Act, unless the stamp duty and penalty due in respect of the instrument is paid, the court cannot act upon the instrument, which means that it cannot act upon the arbitration agreement also which is part of the instruÂ­ ment. Section 35 of the Stamp Act is distinct and different from Section 49 of the RegistraÂ­ tion Act in regard to an unregistered docuÂ­ ment. Section 35 of the Stamp Act, does not contain a proviso like Section 49 of the RegisÂ­ tration Act enabling the instrument to be used to establish a collateral transaction.

20. The Scheme for Appointment of ArbitraÂ­ tors by the Chief Justice of Gauhati High Court, 1996 requires an application under Section 11 of the Act to be accompanied by the original arbitration agreement or a duly certified copy thereof. In fact, such a requireÂ­ ment is found in the scheme/rules of almost all the High Courts. If what is produced is a certified copy of the agreement/contract/inÂ­ strument containing the arbitration clause, it should disclose the stamp duty that has been paid on the original. Section 33 casts a duty upon every court, that is, a person having by law authority to receive evidence (as also evÂ­ ery arbitrator who is a person having by conÂ­ sent of parties, authority to receive evidence) before whom an unregistered instrument chargeable with duty is produced, to examine the instrument in order to ascertain whether it is duly stamped. If the court comes to the conclusion that the instrument is not duly stamped, it has to impound the document and deal with it as per Section 38 of the Stamp Act.

21. Therefore, when a lease deed or any other instrument is relied upon as contending the arbitration agreement, the court should conÂ­ sider at the outset, whether an objection in that behalf is raised or not, whether the docÂ­ ument is properly stamped. If it comes to the conclusion that it is not properly stamped, it should be impounded and dealt with in the manner specified in Section 38 of the Stamp Act. The court cannot act upon such a docuÂ­ ment or the arbitration clause therein. But if the deficit duty and penalty is paid in the manner set out in Section 35 or Section 40 of the Stamp Act, the document can be acted upon or admitted in evidence.â

20. It can thus clearly be seen, that this Court has in unequivocal terms held, that when a lease deed or any other instrument is relied upon as containing the arbitration agreement, the Court is required to consider at the outset, whether the document is properly stamped or not. It has been held, that even when an objection in that behalf is not raised, it is the duty of the Court to consider the issue. It has further been held, that if the Court comes to the conclusion, that the instrument is not properly stamped, it should be impounded and dealt with, in the manner specified in Section 38 of the Stamp Act, 1899. It has also been held, that the Court cannot act upon such a document or the arbitration clause therein. However, if the deficit duty and penalty is paid in the manner set out in Section 35 or Section 40 of the Stamp Act, 1899, the document can be acted upon or admitted in evidence. It is needless to state, that the provisions that fell for consideration before this Court are analogous with the provisions of Sections 33 and 34 of the Karnataka Stamp Act, 1957. In this view of the matter, we are of the considered view, that in view of the law laid down in the case of SMS Tea Estates Private Limited (supra), that the lease deed containing the arbitration clause which is required to be duly stamped, was not sufficiently stamped and though the Registrar (Judicial) had directed the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 to pay deficit stamp duty and penalty of Rs.1,01,56,388/Â­ (Rupees One crore One lakh fiftyÂ­six thousand Three hundred and EightyÂ­eight only), the respondents failed to do so, the High Court has erred in relying on the said lease dated 12.3.1997.

21. Though the appellants deserve to succeed only on the aforesaid question of law, we find, that even on equity the respondents are not entitled to any relief.

22. After lease deed was executed in the year 1996Â­1997, though the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 have placed on record some settlement deeds with tenants executed in 1998, except one bald statement, that last of the tenants was evicted in the year 2010, nothing has been placed on record. It appears, that only after the appellants had filed a suit for injunction against the respondents which was duly contested by the respondents by filing written statement on 18.6.2011, the respondents after participating in the suit proceedings for a period of about 2 years and 3 months, filed the present application before the High Court under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration Act. It is further to be noted, that if in the pursuit of the respondents, the lease deed dated 12.3.1997 was legal and valid document and it could be relied on for referring the dispute to arbitration in view of clause 36 thereof, nothing precluded them from filing an application under Section 8 of the Arbitration Act before the City Civil Court at Bangalore in O.S. No.8952 of 2010 at the earliest opportunity available. It appears, that the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 are taking selfÂ­contradictory stands. In the written statement before the City Civil Court at Bangalore, they have admitted, that the document was a lease deed, whereas before the High Court they have taken a stand, that the document was an agreement for developing the property after the property is made vacant by evicting the tenants. The stand is also totally contrary to the terms expressed in the lease deed. It will be relevant to refer to clause 5 of the lease deed dated 12.3.1997, which reads thus:

â5. The tenure of the lease shall be 38 years commencing from the date of signing of this lease deed.â
23. It can thus clearly be seen, that the tenure of the lease deed was to be 38 years from the date of signing of the lease deed.

24. A perusal of the clauses of the lease deed dated 12.3.1997 would also reveal, that the lessee had undertaken all the responsibility of obtaining vacant possession of Schedule âBâ property and to secure vacant possession by ejecting the unauthorised occupants. Responsibility of sanctioning the building plans was also undertaken by the respondents. It would further reveal, that it was also agreed between the parties, that in the event of any of the tenants approaching a court of law, such period of litigation shall not in any manner affect the agreed tenure of the lease deed of 38 years.

25. In that view of the matter, the submission made by Shri Balaji Srinivasan, learned counsel for the respondents, that the agreement was to be registered only after all the tenants were evicted and the building plans were sanctioned is not supported by any of the terms in the lease deed dated 12.3.1997.

26. In that view of the matter, we find, that the High Court has totally erred in relying on the lease deed dated 12.3.1997, which was found to be insufficiently stamped and brushing aside the report of the Registrar (Judicial), when the respondents had failed to pay the insufficient stamp duty and penalty as determined by the Registrar (Judicial) of the High Court of Karnataka.

27. In the result, the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment and order dated 1.12.2014 passed by the High Court of Karnataka in CMP No.167 of 2013 is quashed and set aside. The petition/application filed by the respondents under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act is rejected. There shall be no order as to costs.",ld
". This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and order dated 31.08.2012 passed by the High Court in Second Appeal No. 5 of 1995. By the impugned judgment, the High Court has set aside the concurrent findings of the Courts below resulting in dismissal of the suit filed by the respondents (plaintiffs) on the ground that the suit was barred by Order II Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to âthe CPCâ) as also constructive res Signature Not Verified Digitally signed by judicata. The High Court has remanded the matter ARJUN BISHT Date: 2019.05.10 18:06:36 IST to the First Appellate Court to decide on merits. Reason:

2. One Tikaram was the husband of respondent No.4 and the father of respondent Nos. 1 to 3. He was holding 8.22 acres of land in Khasra No.189 at Village Gondia in his name. On 21.01.1959, he sold the land to the extent of 3.20 acres out of the total 8.22 acres to the appellants and thereafter, on 11.02.1959, he sold the remaining portion of 4.82 acres of land, which was the balance out of 8.22 acres, also to the appellants. Tikaram passed away on 15.07.1959.

2. The respondents filed a suit (bearing Civil Suit No. 131 of 1963) for setting aside the Sale Deed dated 21.01.1959 and for other reliefs. The allegation made by the respondents in the suit was that the land was a joint family ancestral property and he had sold it for immoral purposes and in a manner prejudicial to the interest of joint family. He was addicted to drink and there was no necessity to sell the property.

3. On 31.01.1969, the Trial Court dismissed the said suit holding that Tikaram was the owner of the property due to the partition effected in the year 1957. Hence, he had the right to sell the suit land. The appellants were bona fide purchasers.

4. Aggrieved by the decree of the Trial Court, the respondents filed an appeal (bearing Civil Appeal NO. 22 of 1969) on 10.02.1971.

5. The respondents again filed the present suit (bearing Civil Suit No. 34 of 1971) challenging the Sale Deed dated 11.02.1959 and seeking other reliefs. It is the said suit which came to be dismissed both by the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court. The Trial Court answered the issues including whether the Suit is barred under Order II Rule 2 and also affected by constructive res judicata. It found that the suit is liable to be dismissed on the ground of Order II Rule 2 and constructive res judicata. The dismissal by the Appellate Court was essentially on the basis of the provisions of Order II Rule 2 of the CPC as also constructive res judicata on the score that the second alienation dated 21.02.1959 ought to have been the subject matter of the earlier suit. The Appellate Court, in fact, found that the Trial Court was right in answering the other points. It is to be noted that the judgment of the Trial Court in the first suit came to be reversed in the civil appeal and the same has become final.

6. The High Court, however, reversing the orders of both the courts found that Order II Rule 2 will not be a bar. For Order II Rule 2, the cause of action in the first suit and the cause of action in the second suit must be identical. In this case, there were two alienations by the Tikaram giving rise to two cause of actions. It is also found that constructive res judicata will not apply.

7. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.

8. Learned counsel for the appellants contended that the High Court has clearly erred in coming to the conclusion that Order II Rule 2 was not a bar. Order II Rule 2 is indeed attracted. He took us through the pleadings in the two suits and contended that the cause of action in the second suit is identical with the cause of action in the first suit. As on the date of the institution of the first suit, the second alienation was very  much available to be impugned and it is not open to the respondents to split the cause of action in separate suits and seek relief which is precisely what has been done by the respondents in this case. He relied upon the judgment of this Court in Coffee Board v. Ramesh Exports Private Limited1 and A.B.C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. v. A.P. Agencies, Salem2.

9. Learned counsel for the respondents drew our attention to Order VII Rule 1. He points out that the cause of action in both the suits are different. He also drew our attention to Article 109 of the Limitation Act, 1963, which reads as follows:

109.

      10.     He     would    contend           that     the       period     of

      limitation       as    far    as    the     second      sale   deed    is


1   (2014) 6 SCC 424
2   (1989) 2 SCC 163


 different from the period of limitation as far as the first sale deed is concerned. The period of limitation as far as the second alienation is concerned will expire only on the expiry of 12 years from the date of taking of possession by the alienee. He further relied on the judgment of this Court in Alka Gupta v. Narender Gupta3.

11. The first question, which we are called upon to decide, is whether the High Court was right in holding that the bar, under Order II Rule 2, will not apply in the facts of this case.

12. Before, we advert to the decisions on the point it would be profitable to refer to the pleadings in two suits.

13. In Civil Suit No. 131 of 1963, we notice the following pleadings. The respondents (plaintiffs) are Hindus governed by Mitakshara School of Law as administered by Benaras School. Tikaramâs father died when Tikaram was a minor. During the minority of Tikaram, the property was managed by his mother. On becoming major, Tikaram fell into bad and immoral habits and grew into a drunkard. 3 (2010) 10 SCC 141 He was also addicted to other vices. He indulged in wasteful habits and therefore sold his joint family ancestral property for immoral purposes and in a manner prejudicial to the interest of the joint family. On the intervention of relations, a partition was entered into on 11.01.1957, which was duly registered.

14. At the time of partition, plaintiff No.2 though begotten was born afterwards on 02.06.1957 and as such he could not and was not made a party to the above partition. Plaintiff No. 3 was born on 26.08.1959 and therefore he had interest in the suit property. At the time of partition, in Khasra No. 189 an area of 8.22 acres was not included in the share of either deceased Tikaram or plaintiff No.1 but was kept joint thereafter. We may notice the following:

â(g) That in or about the month of September, 1958, plaintiffs knew that Tikaram wanted to sale their lands and hence they published a general prohibitory notice in the issue dated 14th September, 1958 of the Hindu Daily âNAVBHARATâ which has wide circulation at Gondia and the surrounding area warning public in general not to accept any transfer of land from deceased Tikaram. That subsequently the  plaintiffs learnt that the defendants intended to enter into a contract of sale with deceased Tikaram in respect of the suit land and hence they served the defendants with a written notice dated 4.1.1959 asking them to desist from purchasing land mentioned in para 1(e) above.
3.That, however, despite warning and notices the defendants purchased a portion of Kh.No. 189 admeasuring 3.20 acres, as particularly described in the plaintiff map by letters Pa, Pha, Ba, Bha, Ma and in red colour, for the alleged consideration of Rs.8,000/- vide registered sale deed dated 21.1.1959.â
15. It is the further case that the property was the ancestral joint family property and the alienation was not one for necessity or for conferring benefits upon the estate or for payment of antecedent debt. It is liable to be set aside. Plaintiff Nos. 1 to 3 have interest in the land by birth and plaintiff No. 4 (the widow of Tikaram) had a share with them. The payment of consideration is fictitious and it never passed. Being without consideration, the alienations were not valid and not binding on the plaintiffs and thus liable to be set aside for this reason. Thereafter, there were certain further allegations with which we are not concerned.

16. The reliefs sought by the plaintiffs in the plaint were to declare the sale deed as not binding on the interest of plaintiff No. 4 and for delivery of possession to her or in the alternative a decree for setting aside the sale deed dated 21.01.1957 and for delivery of possession to the plaintiff, enquiry as to mesne profits and for mandatory injunction to demolish certain constructions.

17. Let us now look at the pleadings in the second suit viz. Civil Suit No. 34 of 1971.

18. Herein also, the plaintiffs and the defendants are the same. It is stated inter alia as follows:

The Bhumidhari land Kh. No. 189 area 8.22 acres situated in village Gondia is the ancestral property of plaintiff Nos. 1, 2 and 3. Plaintiff No. 4 is the mother of plaintiff Nos. 1 to 3. The plaintiffs are Hindu and are governed by Mitakshara Law as administered by Benaras School. The same allegations were raised about Tikaram having fallen into immoral habits and growing into an incorrigible drunkard and selling joint family ancestral lands for immoral purposes. It also referred to partition dated 11.01.1957. There were also allegations relating to Kh. No. 189 wherein 8.22 acres of land was not included either in the share of deceased Tikaram or plaintiff No.1 but was kept joint. It is relevant to extract para 3 of the second plaint which is to the following effect:-

âThat, however, despite warning and notices the defendants purchased a portion of Kh. NO. 189 from the deceased father of the plaintiffs admeasuring 3.20 acres vide sale deed dated 21.01.1959. The plaintiffs have filed C.S. No. 131 of 1963 against the defendants for setting aside the said sale. The suit having been dismissed by the trial court the plaintiffs have filed Civil Appeal No. 22/69 against the said judgment and decree which is now pending in the Court of the Assistant Judge, at Bhandara 4(a).
That Tikaram the deceased father of the plaintiffs again on 11.02.1959 sold an area of 4.82 acres out of suit Kh. No. 189 to the plaintiffs under the same circumstances stated above and as described in the plaintiff map by letters Ka, Kha, Ga, Gha, Cha, Chha, Ja, Ta, Tha, Da, Na and Pa and in red colour, for the alleged consideration of Rs.4000/- vide registered sale deed dated 11.2.1959  and the same is sought to be set aside in this suit.â

19. It is further stated that the land is to be treated as an ancestral joint family property and the alienation being not one for necessity or for conferring benefits upon the estate or for payment of antecedent debt and it is liable to be set aside.

20. Having referred to the pleadings, let us examine what the High Court has held. The High Court holds that all successive claims, arising under the same obligation, shall be deemed to constitute one cause of action. It further finds that the crux of the matter is, there are two alienations of separate areas of the land on different dates, and although they are in favour of the same parties, it would give rise to more than one cause of action. It was further found that by restricting to first suit to the first alienation, it could not be found that plaintiff has split-up the claims or split-up the remedies. The execution of the second sale deed in favour of the same party gives rise to distinctive and  separate cause of action. The High Court further proceeds to refer to the illustrations in Order II Rule 2 CPC, which reads as follows:

âA lets a house to B at a yearly rent of Rs. 1200. The rent for the whole of the years 1905, 1906 and 1907 is due and unpaid. A sues B in 1908 only for the rent due for 1906. A shall not afterwards sue B for the rent due for 1905 or 1907â.
21. Thereafter, the High Court proceeds to take a case where A owns two houses and he let them to B. A suit is filed in respect of arrears of rent in respect of one house, though arrears were there in respect of the other house also. The High Court takes the view that it is the choice of the plaintiff either to unite or not to unite both the causes of action and the second suit would not be barred.

22. In the case of Mohammad Khalil Khan v. Mehbub Ali Mian4, the earlier suit related to the property at Oudh. The parties belonged to the Sunni sect and the properties belonged to one Rani Barkatunnissa who owned properties at Shahjahanpur 4 AIR (36) 1949 Privy Council 78 and Oudh. The first suit did not include the property at Shahjahanpur. The Court proceeded to uphold the views taken by the Courts in India and maintained the finding that second suit, in relation to the property at Shahjahanpur, was barred by virtue of Order II Rule 2. It would be profitable to refer to paragraphs 45 and 46 as they throw light upon what constitutes cause of action:

â45. Shortly stated O.2, R.2, Civil P.C., enacts that if a plaintiff fails to sue for the whole of the claim which he is entitled to make in respect of a cause of action in the first suit, then he is precluded from suing in a second suit in respect of the portion so omitted. As pointed out in Moonshee Buzloor Ruheem v. Shumsunnissa Begum, (1867) 11 M.I.A. 551.
The correct test in all cases of this kind is, whether the claim in the new suit is, in fact, founded on a cause of action distinct from that which was the foundation of the former suitâ¦.
The object of the rule is clearly to avoid splitting up of claims and to prevent multiplicity of suitsâ.",ld
". These appeals arises out of judgement of the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad dated 31.7.2014, allowing the appeals of the respective Respondent Nos. 1 in the four Civil Appeal Nos. 10683-86 of 2014 before us (hereinafter âRespondent Nos. 1â), Signature Not Verified against judgement and order of the Additional District Judge, Digitally signed by GULSHAN KUMAR ARORA Date: 2019.11.25 16:58:44 IST Reason:

Vadodara dated 2.4.2013 and order dated 30.12.2011 of the Additional Senior Civil Judge, Vadodara; and decreeing the suits SCS Nos. 657-660/1988 filed by Respondent Nos. 1 for specific performance against the Appellants herein.

I. Background Facts

2. This case concerns four suits for specific performance filed by the Respondent Nos. 1/Plaintiffs against the Appellants/Defendants Nos. 1-5. One Naranbhai Ramdas Patel (Defendant No. 1, now deceased) was the original owner of property bearing Survey No. 354/1, admeasuring 1 acre and 31 gunthas in Village Manjalpur of Vadodara district (hereinafter âsuit propertyâ). He, along with Defendants Nos. 2-5 (relatives of Defendant No. 1) executed agreement to sell dated 11.3.1986 (â1986 agreementâ) in respect of the suit property in favour of Respondent Nos. 3-11/Defendants Nos. 6-9 (hereinafter âoriginal vendeesâ), for which the original vendees paid earnest money of Rs. 1,54,251. The suit property was included in Town Planning Scheme No. 19 of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation and possession of the suit property was to be given to the original vendees once the aforesaid Scheme was finalized. A registered sale deed in respect of the suit property was to be executed upon receipt of the remaining consideration from the original vendees, the deadline for which was within three months of finalization of the Town Planning Scheme.

The case of Respondent Nos. 1 is that the original vendees thereafter executed four agreements to sell dated 14.9.1987 (â1987 agreementsâ) in respect of four different portions of the suit property, assigning the formerâs rights under the 1986 agreement in the latterâs favour, and that earnest money of Rs. 5000/- was paid under each agreement. Notably, the Appellants were not parties to the 1987 agreements.

Under the 1987 agreements, it was purportedly open to Respondent Nos. 1 to make preparations for construction of a housing scheme over the suit property and issue advertisement for the same. Hence they claim that consequently, possession of the suit property was given to them, that a Bhoomi Pujan was conducted for laying foundation stone on the land and the members of the housing scheme were also registered. Further, that they also obtained the layout plan and construction permission for the housing scheme from Vadodara Municipal Corporation at their own cost, and the deceased original owner Mr. Naranbhai Patel had put his signature on the layout plan.

Subsequently, dispute arose between the parties, and the original vendees filed suit SCS No. 194/1988 on 4.4.1988 before the Learned Civil Judge (Senior Division) at Vadodara (hereinafter âtrial courtâ), seeking specific performance of the 1986 agreement against the Appellants. They claimed that they had served notice to the Appellants on 11.3.1988 seeking execution of sale deed in their favour, but the latter had given evasive reply to the same; that they were deliberately avoiding execution of sale deed so as to take advantage of increase in real estate prices. Per contra, the Appellants claimed that they had on 25.3.1988, by way of reply to the original vendeesâ legal notice, cancelled the 1986 agreement as the original vendees had not paid the remaining consideration as required.

Respondent Nos. 1 were not party to SCS No. 194/1988; and no averment was made in the said suit regarding the 1987 agreements. Instead, on 21.11.88, Respondent Nos. 1 filed four separate suits SCS Nos. 657-660/1988 against the Appellants and the original vendees seeking specific performance of the 1987 agreements. Respondent Nos. 1 alleged that the Appellants and the original vendees were conniving with each other to deny their rights under the 1987 agreements, so as to sell the land to a third party in view of the increasing price of real estate in Vadodara.

The Appellants in their written statements to SCS Nos. 657- 660/1988 denied having any dealings with Respondent Nos. 1 and also stated that the original vendees had never informed them about the 1987 agreements. They averred that since the original vendees had never become the legal owners of the suit property, they did not have any right or authority to enter into any kind of transaction qua the land with Respondent Nos. 1; and that the plaints were concocted to usurp the land.

Both sets of suits, SCS No. 194/1988 and SCS Nos. 657- 660/1988, remained pending for a number of years. During that period, notably, the Appellants and the original vendees acting together executed a Power-of-Attorney dated 11.11.2001 in favour of one Dhananjay Vallabhbhai Patel. It was stated in the Power-of-Attorney that the Appellants and the original vendees are relinquishing their rights in the suit property to Mr. Dhananjay Patel for the purpose of executing sale deed in favour of one Kantilal Ambalal Patel, who is the uncle of the said Dhananjay Patel.

A. Proceedings in SCS No. 194/1988 (Original vendeesâ suit)

3. The original vendees filed withdrawal pursis on 26.7.2002 seeking to unconditionally withdraw SCS No. 194/1988 on the ground that the 1986 agreement was fraudulently registered; that they were not aware of the identity of the true owners of the suit property at the time of the 1986 agreement as it was executed through a broker, that the original owners of the suit property had not signed the agreement, nor had they received any consideration; and the 1986 agreement was fraudulently registered, hence no dispute could be raised regarding the suit property. On the same day, Respondent Nos. 1 sought impleadment as co-plaintiffs in SCS No. 194/1988.  The trial court by way of common order dated 22.9.2002 rejected the original vendeesâ withdrawal application and allowed the impleadment applications of Respondent Nos. 1. The High Court in revision reversed the trial courtâs order, though without going into the merits of the claim made by Respondent Nos. 1. The Court held that the original vendees had an absolute right to withdraw their suit unconditionally irrespective of their motivations for the same. Further, that it was open to Respondent Nos. 1 to raise all available contentions in their separate suits, including admissions, if any, made by the original vendees in their suit SCS No. 194/1988. It was noted that Respondent Nos. 1 cannot be permitted to substitute the original vendees as plaintiffs, as otherwise substantial amendment would be required to the original vendeesâ plaint. The special leave petitions filed by Respondent Nos. 1 against the High Court judgement were dismissed by this Court by order dated 16.11.2004 in SLP (Civil) Nos. 22664-65/2004.

Respondent Nos. 1 subsequently made application in SCS No. 658 of 2008, for revival of SCS No. 194/1988, contending that the original vendees had been misled into withdrawing the latter suit; however the application was dismissed by the trial court and the High Court by orders dated 24.1.2008 and 25.3.2008 respectively. Hence the withdrawal of the original vendeesâ suit has attained finality.

B. Proceedings in SCS Nos. 657-660/1988 (Present suit)

4. It is relevant to note that though the original plaints in SCS Nos. 657-660/1988 were seeking specific performance only of the 1987 agreements, Respondent Nos. 1 amended their plaints in 2005 to seek a declaration that the 1986 agreement is still in force and that the Appellants were bound to execute the 1986 agreement on the basis of the assignment made in their favour.

The trial court by common order dated 30.12.2011 dismissed all four suits. It rejected Respondent Nos.1/Plaintiffsâ contention that the original vendees had withdrawn their suit SCS No. 194/1988 in collusion with the Appellants herein. This was based on the reasoning that the High Court and this Court had, in the earlier proceedings, sanctioned the unconditional withdrawal of SCS No. 194/1988 and not made any finding of judicial impropriety or fraud.

The trial court further found that in light of revocation of the 1986 agreement by the Appellants and withdrawal of SCS No. 194/1988 by the original vendees, it was not open to the Plaintiffs to re-agitate for specific performance of the said agreement. That in any case, even if the 1986 agreement was assumed to be in force, the original vendees could not have assigned their outstanding obligation to pay the remaining consideration without the written consent of the original owner i.e., Defendant No. 1 Naranbhai. Since the 1987 agreements and the 1986 agreement were not ad idem, and new conditions were laid down in the 1987 agreements, such consent was indispensable.

That neither of the Appellants had given any such consent, either verbally or by conduct; nor was there any evidence that the original vendees had paid the remaining consideration to the Appellants, such that the formerâs rights under the 1986 agreement had fortified and consequently passed on to the Plaintiffs under the 1987 agreements. Therefore the 1987 agreements were void, illegal and unenforceable. Further, that the 1987 agreements were also vague and unenforceable inasmuch as the suit property was not specifically defined therein.

The trial court additionally held that the Plaintiffs had not taken any steps, such as depositing the remaining consideration owed by the original vendees, or paying betterment tax as per the terms of the 1987 agreements, to show that they themselves were ready and willing to perform the contracts. Hence this was not a fit case to grant either specific performance or damages, though Respondent Nos. 1 were held entitled to return of the earnest money paid by them with interest.

The Learned Additional District Judge, Vadodara by judgement dated 2.04.2013 affirmed the trial courtâs findings. It was re-emphasized that a party to a contract cannot assign their obligations thereunder without the other partyâs consent. There was nothing on record to show that the Appellants had given such consent. In any case, since the original vendees had never shown their readiness and willingness to pay the balance consideration due by them, no right of specific performance had accrued in their favour. Further, that the original vendees had anyway waived their rights by withdrawing their suit in SCS No. 194/1988. Hence the question of assignment of such a right to Respondent Nos. 1, such that they could claim specific performance of the 1986 agreement as representatives-in-interest of the original vendees under Section 15(b) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 (âSpecific Relief Actâ) did not arise.

However, the High Court in the impugned judgement found that there was a definite linkage between the 1986 agreement and the 1987 agreements such that there was a valid assignment of rights in favour of Respondent Nos.1, which made them ârepresentatives-in-interestâ of the original vendees for the purpose of Section 15(b) of the Specific Relief Act. The High Court reasoned that since all the material rights under the 1986 agreement were assigned under the 1987 agreements, supplementary conditions specified in the latter did not change the nature of the basic contract.

 Further, that reading Sections 40 and 54 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (âTransfer of Property Actâ) and Section 15(b) of the Specific Relief Act together, the âinterestâ assignable under Section 15(b) need not be an interest in the property or a charge created in the property. A contractual interest in the form of an obligation annexed to ownership of the property may also be assignable. It was discernible from the facts and evidence on record that the Appellants had given implied consent for such assignment. Mr. Naranbhai Patelâs signature on planning permissions and his presence at the Bhoomi Pujan ceremony were taken as proof that the original owners had consented to the involvement of Respondent Nos. 1 in developing a housing scheme on the suit property. Therefore, it was found that the 1986 agreement remained alive, and the rights derived therefrom in favour of the original vendees were validly assigned under the 1987 agreements.

Additionally, since the High Court and this Court had clarified while sanctioning withdrawal of SCS No. 194/1988 that such withdrawal would not preclude Respondent Nos. 1 from pursuing their independent remedies, the withdrawal of the original vendeesâ suit could not prejudice the rights of Respondent Nos. 1 to specific performance. That actual tendering of money was not necessary to evince readiness and willingness to perform the contract as required under Section 16(c) of the Specific Relief Act, and the specific averments made in the pleadings by Respondent Nos. 1 would suffice.

It may be relevant to note at this juncture that the High Court by interim order dated 27.6.2013 had directed Respondent Nos. 1 to deposit an amount equal to five times the amount of original consideration under the 1987 agreements, and Respondent Nos. 1 have submitted that they are ready and willing to forfeit the entire amount deposited in respect of the relief of specific performance, so as to balance equities between the parties.

We further note from the order sheets maintained by this Court that the parties have been directed to maintain status quo during the pendency of the appeal and no steps have been taken for the execution of the impugned judgement.

II. Issues and Submissions made by the Parties

5. Therefore, upon a perusal of the entire record, the following issues arise for our consideration:

Firstly, whether there was a valid assignment of rights by the original vendees in favour of Respondent Nos. 1 under the 1987 agreements?

Secondly, whether the right of Respondent Nos. 1 to seek specific performance survives subsequent to the cancellation of the 1986 agreement by the Appellants and withdrawal of suit in SCS No. 194/1988 by the original vendees?

Thirdly, whether relief may be granted to Respondent Nos. 1, and if so, of what nature?

6. Learned senior counsel for the Appellants, Mr. Ranjit Kumar argued that there was no privity of contract between the Appellants and Respondents Nos. 1 in the respective appeals. That the 1987 agreements were contingent contracts under Section 31 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (âContract Actâ), as the rights therein could only be enforced upon the completion of the 1986 agreement, and the interest created under the 1987 agreements was also a âcontingent interestâ under Section 21 of the Transfer of Property Act. Since the 1986 agreement was cancelled, Respondent Nos. 1 could not seek specific performance of the 1987 agreements.

Further, that the purported âassignmentâ under the 1987 agreements practically amounted to a novation of the 1986 agreement, and the Appellants had not accorded any consent for such an assignment. Even if such an assignment had taken place, there was no evidence to show that Respondent Nos. 1 were ready and willing to perform their contractual obligations. Respondent Nos. 1 had never communicated their willingness to complete their contractual obligations under the 1986 agreement to the Appellants.

Per contra, learned senior counsel for Respondent No. 1, Mr. C.U. Singh argued that the Appellants i.e. the landowners were colluding with the original vendees to avoid sale of the suit property, as evidenced by the fact that the original vendees had not contested the suit at any point of time. He brought to this Courtâs notice that there could not have been a termination of the 1986 agreement in 1988 given that in the Power-of-Attorney dated 11.11.2001 (supra) executed by Defendant Nos. 1-9 (the Appellants and the original vendees) in favour of Mr. Dhananjay Patel, it is stated that the original vendees have acquired rights in the suit property under the 1986 agreement. It is not open to the Appellants to accept the existence of the 1986 agreement in the Power-of-Attorney and reject it for the purpose of these suits.

He further relied upon this Courtâs decisions in Shyam Singh v. Daryao Singh (Dead) By LRs. and Others , (2003) 12 SCC 160, Ram Baran Prasad v. Ram Mohit Hazra and Others, AIR 1967 SC 744 and Habiba Khatoon v. Ubaidul Huq and others, (1997) 7 SCC 452 to argue that no implied prohibition can be read into the 1986 agreement against assignability of the interest therein. The requirement of consent of the other party for assignment under Section 15(b) of the Specific Relief Act is only applicable in cases where the obligation is of a personal nature or where there is an express bar in the contract prohibiting such assignment of interest. Further, that in any case, the original owner Naranbhai Patelâs conduct in arranging for development permissions and consenting to publication of advertisement regarding development of housing scheme in the suit property shows that there was implied consent for assignment of rights under the 1986 agreement in favour of Respondent Nos. 1.

III. Validity of Assignment of Rights under 1987 Agreements.

A. General principles governing assignability of contracts

7. Upon considering the facts and circumstances of the present case, it is evident that there is no privity of contract between the Appellants and Respondent Nos. 1. Respondent Nos. 1 were not party to the 1986 agreement. Vice versa, the Appellants were not party to the 1987 agreements, though whether or not they had knowledge of the same is disputed. Hence Respondent Nos. 1 cannot seek specific performance of the 1986 agreement, or for that matter, the 1987 agreements, against the Appellants, except by suing as ârepresentatives-in-interestâ of the original vendees under Section 15(b) of the Specific Relief Act. Section 15(b) provides that:

 â15. Who may obtain specific performance.â Except as otherwise provided by this Chapter, the specific performance of a contract may be obtained by â â¦(b) the representative in interest or the principal, of any party thereto: Provided that where the learning, skill, solvency or any personal quality of such party is a material ingredient in the contract, or where the contract provides that his interest shall not be assigned, his representative in interest or his principal shall not be entitled to specific performance of the contract, unless such party has already performed his part of the contract, or the performance thereof by his representative in interest, or his principal, has been accepted by the other partyâ¦â It is well-settled that the term ârepresentative-in-interestâ includes the assignee of a contractual interest. Though the provisions of the Contract Act do not particularly deal with the assignability of contracts, this Court has opined time and again that a party to a contract cannot assign their obligations/liabilities without the consent of the other party. A Constitution Bench of this Court in Khardah Company Ltd v. Raymon & Co (India) Private Ltd., AIR 1962 SC 1810 has laid out this principle as follows:

ââ¦An assignment of a contract might result by transfer either of the rights or of the obligations thereunder. But  there is a well-recognised distinction between these two classes of assignments. As a rule obligations under a contract cannot be assigned except with the consent of the promisee, and when such consent is given, it is really a novation resulting in substitution of liabilities. On the other hand, rights under a contract are assignable unless the contract is personal in its nature or the rights are incapable of assignment either under the law or under an agreement between the parties.â (emphasis supplied) In Khardah Company, the Appellant jute manufacturers were entitled to receive price for the jute from the buyer/dealer of jute only upon delivery of certain shipping documents. Question arose as to whether such an obligation coupled with a benefit was assignable. This Court held, based on the above-mentioned principle, that the terms of the contract strongly implied that the rights thereunder are non-transferable.",ld
"SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.

1. The Agriculture Department of the Government of Sikkim (respondent No.2) sought to acquire, in the year 1980, land measuring 8.36 acres, located in Dundung Block, Sang in East Sikkim for the purpose of building the Progeny Orchard Regional Centre. The land was recorded in two names â 1.29 acres in the name of the Maharaja of Signature Not Verified Digitally signed by ASHA SUNDRIYAL Date: 2020.03.02 16:21:35 IST Sikkim and 7.07 acres in the name of Man Bahadur Basnett, father of the Reason:

original appellant. The latter land is subject matter of dispute in the present proceedings.

2. The land in question is partially fenced, with a farm, some barracks and office. Late Man Bahadur Basnett passed away in the year 1991 whereupon the property fell to the share of the appellant in the present proceedings (now represented by his two sons). It may be noticed that Man Bahadur Basnett was survived by seven (7) children, but there is no dispute inter se the siblings in respect of the claim of D.B. Basnett over suit property.

3. It is the case of the late appellant that when he visited the suit property in March, 2002, he found that the respondents had wrongly encroached and trespassed on the same, using it as an agricultural farm. He claims to have lived away from Gangtok earlier and thus, served a notice on 5.4.2002 under Section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 notifying them against the alleged trespass and seeking possession. There was no response to the same and, thus, the suit was filed before the Court of District Judge (E&N), Gangtok, Sikkim, being the Title Suit No.6/2004 (renumbered) on 9.12.2002.

4. The sum and substance of the claim made was that the procedure envisaged under the Sikkim Land (Requisition and Acquisition) Act, 1977 (hereinafter referred to as the âsaid Actâ) had not been invoked or followed. Suffice to say that the process is similar to the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as the â1894 Actâ), i.e., notification required under Section 4 of the Act for acquisition of land, opportunity to interested persons to file claims under Section 5 of the Act and the determination of the amount of compensation under Section 7 of the Act. The plea raised was that no notice of acquisition was ever published, nor any process followed for the same.

5. Respondent No. 2 sought to raise a defence to the suit of the bar of limitation. It is their say that the Agriculture Department had followed due process while acquiring the land in 1980 and had paid compensation of Rs.62,645 to late Man Bahadur Basnett through the Land Revenue Department. Thus they were enjoying peaceful possession of the subject matter property as a consequence thereof. The claim of the late appellant that rent was being paid to the Government was stated not to be in the knowledge of the Agriculture Department.

6. The trial court dismissed the suit vide judgment and order dated 31.10.2006, both on grounds of limitation as well as substantive merits. The consideration of merits was based on the fact that the original stamped receipts of payment of compensation had been taken note of in the record of proceedings, though the actual receipt was not available. The correspondence exchanged even inter-departmentally was stated to point to the compensation being paid, as also a letter which had been sent by late Man Bahadur Basnett, signifying his consent to transfer suit property upon payment of due compensation.

7. On appeal being filed and registered before the High Court of Sikkim, being RFA No.2/2007, the same was examined on both issues and was dismissed on 29.5.2008. However, insofar as the aspect of limitation was concerned, the High Court disagreed with the findings of the trial court by relying upon Article 65 of the Limitation Act, 1963, which provided for a period of twelve (12) years in case of adverse possession. Such a case of adverse possession was opined to be difficult for the State Government to plead and in any case, on facts, had never been pleaded. It is also recorded that no notification under the said Act had been produced, nor was any record produced in that behalf. The actual signed and stamped receipts were also not placed on record. The inconsistent stand of the Government claiming that they had acquired the land while still collecting land revenue for the same was also noted. These aspects were sought to be balanced with the letter dated 20.3.1980, of late Man Bahadur Basnett, who had given his no objection to the acquisition if compensation was paid to him, and a letter dated 2.4.1980 of the Land Revenue Department forwarding the compensation to the District Collector for payment to late Man Bahadur Basnett. The land revenue records were stated not to be of such significance in the face of these documents, but sympathising with the predicament of the appellant and recognising the weaker position of the Government in the entire dispute, it was observed that the Government had no justification to keep holding on to the land revenue as collected from the appellant. Since no claim was made in that behalf, it was directed that the same should be refunded, if so asked for by the appellant, more so as the Government has to act as a âmodel litigant.â

8. In the SLP filed against the impugned order, leave was granted on 7.1.2011. The matter was, however, taken up for hearing for the first time on 2.5.2019. On hearing learned counsel for the parties, at the request of the learned counsel for the respondents, time was given to scrutinize the record and show to the Court how a sum of Rs.62,645 was withdrawn by the Collector in cash (as alleged and as contended), and which document(s) evidenced payment to late Man Bahadur Basnett. It was observed that this was the least expected considering that the respondents claimed to have lost all records of acquisition proceedings and none of the notifications were available. The order ended by observing that a failure to show the same would necessitate the State Government to acquire the land through fresh notification, if it wants to keep the land.

9. An affidavit was filed in August, 2019, which was analysed on 27.8.2019, and it was found that there was neither any proof of the Collector having withdrawn cash to the tune of Rs.62,645 from the account, nor any receipt from late Man Bahadur Basnett acknowledging the payment, except the stated covering letter for the receipt. In the conspectus of these facts, in order to work out a mutually agreed settlement, the dispute was referred to the Mediation Centre annexed to the High Court of Sikkim. Unfortunately this also did not produce any result, a failure report was received and, thus, the remaining arguments were heard.

10. We may notice that though leave was granted, no cross-objections were filed by the respondents on any aspect including on the finding of limitation.

11. Be that as it may, the fact remains, as noticed by the High Court, that it is not the case of the respondents that they had adverse possession, but that they had acquired the land through due process and had paid compensation for the same. We agree with the High Court that there is no plea even of adverse possession by the respondent. We are not to be detained by the same in this appeal.

12. We are in complete agreement with this view and for this reason also the plea of adverse possession really does not survive.

13. That brings us to the question whether the process of acquisition had been followed in accordance with law. No notification has been shown to us of the intent to acquire land under Section 4, or any other declaration thereafter. In fact what is claimed before us, as also before the courts below, is that no records are available in respect of the acquisition process. This obviously puts the respondent State in a difficult situation, which was sought to be got over by only relying on a consent having been obtained for acquisition and the compensation having been paid, as determined. On the aspect of the compensation, only a covering letter is available, and not the actual receipt. We have also observed aforesaid that an unusual process of making payment in cash is claimed to have been adopted, and the amount is not an insignificant amount, if we look at the year of acquisition. We even gave a further opportunity to the authorities to show, as to from which account this compensation was withdrawn by the Collector, but it appears that there is no proof even of the withdrawal of the amount, much less payment of the compensation. The letter dated 20.3.1980 of late Man Bahadur Basnett is no doubt a no- objection to the acquisition of land, but provided compensation was paid subsequently. This letter does not obviate the need to furnish proof of the process for acquisition of land or for the determination of compensation, under the said Act. There cannot be a presumption of acquisition without following the due process as envisaged under Sections 3(1), 4(2), 5(1) and 7(2) of the said Act. The burden was on the State to prove that the process as envisaged under the said Act was followed and the compensation paid. Not an iota of evidence has been laid in support of any of these aspects, except the willingness of late Man Bahadur Basnett to permit the land to be acquired on payment of compensation, the forwarding of the amount by the Land Revenue Department to the District Collector through a cheque, and thereafter a letter from the Collector/respondent No.1 stating that some receipt was being enclosed, acknowledging the payment in cash (without a receipt being found). There is, thus, absence of both primary and secondary evidence.

14. We may note that even though rights in land are no more a fundamental right, still it remains a constitutional right under Article 300A of the Constitution of India, and the provisions of any Act seeking to divest any person from the rights in property have to be strictly followed1.

1N. Padmamma & Ors. v. S. Ramakrishna Reddy &Ors. (2008) 15 SCC 517
15. It is also settled law that following the procedure of Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 18942 (akin to Section 5(1) of the said Act) is mandatory, and unless that notice is given in accordance with the provisions contained therein, the entire acquisition proceeding would be vitiated. An entry into the premises based on such non-compliance would result in the entry being unlawful3. The law being ex-propriatory in character, the same is required to be strictly followed. The purpose of the notice is to intimate the interested persons about the intent to acquire the land. These provisions, as they read, of the said Act, thus, are also required to be so followed.

16. We find a detailed discussion about the law as it evolved and the rationale for the said purpose in Vidya Devi4 of which the relevant paragraphs read as under:

â10.1. The Appellant was forcibly expropriated of her property in 1967, when the right to property was a fundamental right guaranteed by Article 31 in Part III of the Constitution.
2Publication of Preliminary Notification and Powers of Officers thereupon. 3Narinderjit Singh & Ranjit Singh & Ors. v. State of U.P. &Ors., Etc. (1973) 1 SCC 4(supra) Article 31 guaranteed the right to private property (The State of West Bengal v. Subodh Gopal Bose and Ors. AIR 1954 SC 92), which could not be deprived without due process of law and upon just and fair compensation.

10.2. The right to property ceased to be a fundamental right by the Constitution (Forty Fourth Amendment) Act, 1978, however, it continued to be a human right (Tukaram Kana Joshi & Ors. v. M.I.D.C. & Ors. (2013) 1 SCC 353) in a welfare State, and a Constitutional right under Article 300A of the Constitution. Article 300 A provides that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law. The State cannot dispossess a citizen of his property except in accordance with the procedure established by law. The obligation to pay compensation, though not expressly included in Article 300A, can be inferred in that Article (K T Plantation Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Karnataka (2011) 9 SCC 1).

To forcibly dispossess a person of his private property, without following due process of law, would be violative of a human right, as also the constitutional right under Article 300 A of the Constitution.

Reliance is placed on the judgment in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. v. Darius Shapur Chennai (2005) 7 SCC 627,wherein this Court held that:

â 6. â¦ Having regard to the provisions contained in Article 300A of the Constitution, the State in exercise of its power of ""eminent domain"" may interfere with the right of property of a person by acquiring the same but the same must be for a public purpose and reasonable compensation therefor must be paid.â (emphasis originally supplied) In N. Padmamma v. S. Ramakrishna Reddy (2008) 15 SCC 517, this Courtheld that:
â21. If the right of property is a human right as also a constitutional right, the same cannot be taken away except in accordance with law. Article 300A of the Constitution protects such right. The provisions of the Act seeking to divest such right, keeping in view of the provisions of Article 300A of the Constitution of India, must be strictly construed.â (emphasis originally supplied) In Delhi Airtech Services Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. State of U.P.& Ors. (2011) 9 SCC 354, this Court recognized the right to property as a basic human right in the following words:
â30. It is accepted in every jurisprudence and by different political thinkers that some amount of property right is an indispensable safeguard against tyranny and economic oppression of the Government. Jefferson was of the view that liberty cannot long subsist without the support of property."" Property must be secured, else liberty cannot subsist"" was the opinion of John Adams. Indeed the view that property itself is the seed bed which must be conserved if other constitutional values are to flourish is the consensus among political thinkers and jurists.â (emphasis originally supplied) In Jilubhai Nanbhai Khachar v. State of Gujarat, (1995) Supp. 1 SCC 596 this Court held as follows:
â48. â¦In other words, Article 300A only limits the powers of the State that no person shall be deprived of his property  save by authority of law. There has to be no deprivation without any sanction of law. Deprivation by any other mode is not acquisition or taking possession under Article 300A. In other words, if there is no law, there is no deprivation.â (emphasis originally supplied) 10.3. In this case, the Appellant could not have been forcibly dispossessed of her property without any legal sanction, and without following due process of law, and depriving her payment of just compensation, being a fundamental right on the date of forcible dispossession in 1967.
10.4. The contention of the State that the Appellant or her predecessors had âorallyâ consented to the acquisition is completely baseless. We find complete lack of authority and legal sanction in compulsorily divesting the Appellant of her property by the State.

10.5. In a democratic polity governed by the rule of law, the State could not have deprived a citizen of their property without the sanction of law. Reliance is placed on the judgment of this Court in Tukaram Kana Joshi &Ors. v. M.I.D.C. &Ors. (2013) 1 SCC 353 wherein it was held that the State must comply with the procedure for acquisition, requisition, or any other permissible statutory mode. The State being a welfare State governed by the rule of law cannot arrogate to itself a status beyond what is provided by the Constitution.

This Court in State of Haryana v. Mukesh Kumar held that the right to property is now considered to be not only a constitutional or statutory right, but also a human right. Human rights have been considered in the realm of individual rights such as  right to shelter, livelihood, health, employment, etc. Human rights have gained a multifaceted dimension.â

17. There is also a discussion in the judgment on the aspect of delay and laches, which is as under:

â10.7. The contention advanced by the State of delay and laches of the Appellant in moving the Court is also liable to be rejected. Delay and laches cannot be raised in a case of a continuing cause of action, or if the circumstances shock the judicial conscience of the Court. Condonation of delay is a matter of judicial discretion, which must be exercised judiciously and reasonably in the facts and circumstances of a case. It will depend upon the breach of fundamental rights, and the remedy claimed, and when and how the delay arose. There is no period of limitation prescribed for the courts to exercise their constitutional jurisdiction to do substantial justice.
In a case where the demand for justice is so compelling, a constitutional Court would exercise its jurisdiction with a view to promote justice, and not defeat it (P.S. Sadasivaswamy v. State of T.N. (1975) 1 SCC 152).
In Tukaram Kana Joshi &Ors. v. M.I.D.C. &Ors. (2013) 1 SCC 353, this Court while dealing with a similar fact situation, held as follows:
âThere are authorities which state that delay and laches extinguish the right to put forth a claim. Most of these authorities pertain to service jurisprudence, grant of compensation for a wrong done to them decades ago, recovery of statutory dues, claim for educational facilities and other categories of similar cases, etc. Though, it is true that there are a few authorities that lay down that delay and laches debar a citizen from seeking remedy, even if his fundamental right has been violated,  under Article 32 or 226 of the Constitution, the case at hand deals with a different scenario altogether. Functionaries of the State took over possession of the land belonging to the Appellants without any sanction of law. The Appellants had asked repeatedly for grant of the benefit of compensation. The State must either comply with the procedure laid down for acquisition, or requisition, or any other permissible statutory mode.â (emphasis originally supplied)
18. The aforesaid legal principles do not leave the respondents with any defence in the given facts of the case.
19. The result of the aforesaid would be that the respondents have failed to establish that they had acquired the land in accordance with law and paid due compensation. The appellant would, thus, be entitled to the possession of the land as also damages for illegal use and occupation of the same by the respondents, at least, for a period of three (3) years prior to the notice having been served upon them. We are strengthened in our observations on account of the judgment of this Court in LAO v. M. Ramakrishna Reddy,5 where it was held that the owner can be entitled to damages for wrongful use and possession of land in respect of which no notification is issued under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, from the date of possession till the date such notification is finally published. 5(2011) 11 SCC 648
20. We are conscious that the land is being used by the respondent- State through respondent No.2 Department. That, however, does not give such a license to the State Government. We had endeavoured to refer the matter for mediation, to find an amicable solution, but that did not fructify. We, however, would like to give some time to the respondent- State to analyse the consequences of this judgment, and, in case they so desire, to acquire the land through a proper notification under the said Act, and to take proper recourse in law so as to enable them to keep the land. We grant three (3) monthsâ time from the date of the judgment for the respondent-State to make up their mind as to what they want to do. Would they still like to retain the land by issuing a proper notification, or would they like to surrender possession of the land. In either eventuality, the question of payment for use and occupation would still arise, which will have to be determined in accordance with law. Mesne profits would be determined by a Court Commissioner, to be appointed by the trial court, as a relief in that behalf has been sought in the plaint itself.

21. In view of the aforesaid order, the alternative direction passed by the appellate court to refund the land revenue in case of a claim would not arise.

22. The appeal is accordingly allowed, leaving the parties to bear their own costs.",ld
"1. Brief facts of the present case are that on 12.07.2013, the petitioner filed a petition Under Section 14 (1) (a) (b) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 (hereinafter referred to as 'DRC Act') praying to this court to pass an order for eviction in respect of private tin shed No. 12 measuring 25 sq. yards forming part of property No. 8-A, Tatarpur, Main Najafgarh Road, Tagore Garden, New Delhi as shown red in the site plan attached with the petition (hereinafter referred to as ""Tenanted Premises"").

2. The case of the petitioner is that father of the petitioner had been the owner/landlord of property bearing No. 8-A, Tatarpur, Main Najafgarh Road, Tagore Garden, New Delhi- 110027, who unfortunately expired leaving behind two sons and one daughter. The petitioner being one of the owners of the property is competent and powerful for filing the present petition. That the respondents no.1 and 2 are the real brothers and were inducted as tenants by Sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta in private tin shed No. 12 in property No. 8-A, measuring about 25 sq. yards at Tatarpur, Main Najafgarh Road, Tagore Garden, New Delhi-110027. That the rate of rent has been settled at Rs.125/- per month excluding electricity and other charges. The electricity connection was installed in the tenanted premises in the name of respondent No.2 which is lying disconnected. That the respondents without the written consent and permission of the father of the petitioner had created a sub-lettee who is owner of several rickshaws and the respondents against the huge amount had permitted to park the rickshaws in the tenanted premises as well as in the passage. The owner of rickshaws used to lock down and open the tenanted premises with his own keys. The respondents have also created a further sub-letting who is running the scrap business. The respondents further created the sub-letting on the entrance of the passage wherein a sub-lettee namely Sh. Avinash Kumar is running the business of car repairing, denting of auto vehicles and welding work. After the death of the petitioner, the respondents also parted with the possession of tenanted premises for one Sh. Manoj Sharma, Advocate, who had installed his sign board in the beginning of passage of tenanted premises. That the petitioner sent and served a legal notice dated 13.01.2020 calling thereby the respondents to make payments of arrears of rent mentioned. The respondents neither complied with the requisitions of the notice nor sent the reply. The petitioner having no alternative filed an eviction petition against the respondents on the ground of non-payment of rent as well as sub-letting. However, the respondents entered into a compromise with the petitioner. The running case against the respondents was discontinued by the petitioner. That since the respondents backed out from their commitment. The petitioner having no alternative again issued a legal notice dated 12.03.2013 against the respondents through registered A.D. post. The respondents despite the service of the notice dated 12.03.2013 have failed to comply with the legal notice. Respondents despite the service of the notice has neither complied with the requisitions of the notice nor has replied the same.

Lastly, it is prayed by the petitioner that an eviction order may be passed in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents.

3. On the other hand, Written Statement was filed by the respondents in response to the petition filed by the petitioner U/S 14 (1) (a) (b) of the DRC Act, praying to the court to dismiss the present petition with costs.

In their Written Statement, the respondents have inter-alia submitted that the present petition is hit by the provisions of ""res-judicata"" as the petitioner had earlier filed a petition U/S 14(1) of DRC Act which was dismissed in default by the court of Sh. Devinder Kumar, Ld. Predecessor of this Court vide order dated 23.05.2012 in eviction petition No. E-203/11. The property in question belongs to Delhi Development Authority and the matter is still pending before the court of Sh. Rakesh Siddhartha, Ld. ASJ Delhi for adjudication against the order passed by the court of SDM Rampura U/S 133 CrPC. That the present petition is hit by the provisions of Section 41(h) and (i) of the Specific Relief Act as the petitioner has not sought efficacious remedies available to him. That there is no relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties. It is the DDA who is the owner of the premises in question to whom the respondents have been paying damages regularly. DDA on 01.08.1980 vide file No. D/Tatarpr/2/80 had taken a sum of Rs.1400/- from the respondents as damages being the unauthorized occupant of the DDA. The respondents are in possession of the premises and regularly making the a payment of Rs.1400/- towards annual damages. The DDA has also issued No vide letter no. D/Tatarpur/JUG/2/80 dated 8.01.1981 after which the electricity connection was got installed by the respondents. That the said Sh. Avinash Kumar is the real brother of the respondents and there is no question of any sub- letting. Earlier petition on the ground of non-payment was dismissed but the same was not got restored. There is no person by the name of Sh. Manoj Sharma, Advocate and the question of hanging of any sign board in his name did not arise at all. No notice of any kind whatsoever was ever served on the respondents. That there was no question of giving any undertaking or compromising the matter. Lastly, it is prayed by the respondents that the present petition being false and frivolous may be dismissed with costs.

4. Thereafter, replication was filed by the petitioner in which he submitted that the eviction bearing No. E-35/10 was at the stage of evidence. However, the respondents entered into a compromise as the preventive proceedings were initiated by SDM Rampura, Delhi and the respondents had given their undertaking to withdraw the sub-letting from the tenanted premises. Since the respondents had obeyed, performed and accepted the terms of compromise, the petitioner did not continue his earlier proceedings. However, the legal proceedings regarding S.D.M. Rampura, Delhi and the matter pending before Sh. Rakesh Sidhartha, Ld. A.S.J., Tis Hazari Courts, Delhi is a matter of record. It is specifically denied that DDA is the owner of the property in question. It is submitted that earlier, there had been the litigation between the father of the petitioner and the respondents and even the decree of eviction had been passed against the respondents.

5. Thereafter, the matter was fixed for Petitioner's Evidence. The petitioner examined himself as PW-1 and relied upon documents. Petitioner also examined PW2 Sh. Mukesh Kumar, JJA, Record Room (Civil), Tis Hazari Courts, Delhi, PW3 Sh. Mukesh Kumar, LDC, Property Tax Department (West Zone), 59 Block, Ashok Nagar, New Delhi and PW4 Sh. Jai Kumar, JJA, Record Room (Civil), Tis Hazari Court, Delhi. Thereafter, Petitioner's Evidence was closed.

On the other hand, respondent examined Sh. Ravi Kumar as RW-1, RW-2 Sh. Subhash Chander, RW3 Sh. Amit Mathur, Patwari, Land Management West Zone, Subhash Nagar, New Delhi-27 and RW4 Sh. Vivek Choudhary, Asstt. Section Officer, Damage Land Management Coordination, INA, Vikas Sadan, Delhi. Thereafter, respondent's evidence was closed.

6. I have heard the arguments advanced by Ld. Counsel for the petitioner but despite repeated ample opportunites given to to Ld. Counsel for respondents to argue the matter, he did not avail the opportunity. I have also gone through the entire record and case law relied upon. I have also carefully gone through the testimonies of the witnesses, documents and material on record.

7. It is pertinent to mention that although the present petition was filed U/S 14(1)(a) & (b) of DRC Act but on 15.02.2020, the relief U/S 14(1)(b) of DRC Act was withdrawn by the Ld. Counsel for the petitioner. As such, this court has to give the finding only on U/S 14(1)(a) of DRC Act.

LAW ON SEC. 14(1) (a) D.R.C. ACT:-

8. It is expedient to reproduce the relevant provision of Delhi Rent Control Act so that position may be crystal clear:-

""Section-14. Protection of tenant against eviction- (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other law or contract, no order or decree for the recovery of possession of any premises shall be made by court or any controller in favour of the landlord against a tenant:
Provided that the controller may, on an application made to him in the prescribed manner, make an order for recovery of possession of the premises on one or more of the following grounds only, namely:-
(a) that the tenant has neither paid nor tendered the whole arrears of the rent legally recoverable from him within two months of the day on which a notice of demand for the arrears of rent has been served of him by the landlord in the manner provided in Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (4 of 1882).""
As such, the following are the ingredients of section 14(1) proviso (a) :-

(i) There should be a relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties.

(ii) There should be a non-payment or tendering of whole arrears of legally recoverable rent within two months of service of legal notice upon the tenant given by the landlord.

(i). RELATIONSHIP OF LANDLORD AND TENANT:-

9. Perusal of record shows that in the present case, petitioner has claimed to be landlord of the tenanted premises on the basis of landlord of his father Sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta.

On the contrary, the respondents have vehemently disputed the landlordship of the petitioner and also that of Sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta. The stand of the respondents is that DDA is the owner of the tenanted premises and they are paying damages to the DDA.

Perusal of record shows that petitioner has not placed on record any document of his ownership or the ownership of Sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta except Survey Report and judgments of some Courts.

10. I have carefully scrutinized the testimonies of all the witnesses including respondent no. 1 and respondent no. 2 which were examined as RW-1 and RW-2 respectively. It is expedient to reproduce the relevant portion of testimonies of RW-1 and RW-2 which is as under:-

RW-1 Sh. Ravi Kumar in his testimony states that:-
""The address which has been mentioned in my affidavit Ex.RW1/A is not my residential address. My residential address is E-668, Raghubir Nagar, New Delhi-27. The address in property No. 8A/12 has been allotted to me by the DDA. It is correct that in any document issued by the DDA to me address 8A/12 has not been mentioned. Vol. Only 8A Tatar Pur has been mentioned. The property no. 8A/12 has been written by us at our own. The fact that I am in possession of 400 sq. yards including 25 sq. yards which is subject matter of instant eviction petition might have mentioned in my W.S. W.S has been shown to the witness wherein the factum of 400 sq. yards has not been mentioned. I do not remember if I have any government or non-government document showing that I am in possession of 400 sq. yards land in property No. 8A/12, Tatar Pur, New Delhi. The damages receipt also does not show that I am in possession of 400 sq. yards. Vol. In damages receipt 35 sq. yards has been shown. I have never paid the damages against the possession of 400 sq. yards in property No. 8A/12. I do not remember if I have any document either from the office of MCD or from the court showing the possession of 400 sq. yards in property No. 8A/12. We had applied and filed my affidavit in the office of SDMC showing possession of 400 sq. yards. I have not filed that such document in the Court file. I entered into property bearing No. 8A Tatarpur, Delhi in the year 1980. We have encroached upon the land. I had filed a civil case against Sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta and DDA. The said case got dismissed in default due to my non- appearance. I did not get it restored till the date. To my knowledge I had shown myself as owner of the property. I do not remember if my brother Sh. Subhash and Sh. Avinash requested the DDA to get the 35 sq. yard divided into two portions. No damages receipt issued by the DDA is in my name. I have no document to show that I am paying the damages even for a sq. yard in property No. 8A, Tatar Pur, Delhi. It is correct that the document dated 08.01.1981 C/o Sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta has been mentioned. Vol. I do not know why the name of Sh. Jagdish Chander (father of petitioner No.1 has been mentioned in these documents). It is also correct that in the document dated 01.04.1982 C/o Sh. Jagdish Chander R/o 8A Tatarpur has been mentioned. Vol. I do not know why the name of Sh. Jagdish Chander (father of petitioner No.1 has been mentioned in these documents). It is also correct that document dated 29.03.1982 C/o Sh. Jagdish Chander R/o 8A Tatarpur has been mentioned. Vol. I do not know why the name of Sh. Jagdish Chander (father of petitioner No.1 has been mentioned in these documents). I recognised the signature of my brother Sh. Subhash Chand Sharma on application given by him to the Estate Officer and which is Ex.RW1/P1. It is wrong to suggest that my brother had given in writing by virtue of application Ex.RW1/P1 that he is the tenant of Sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta and he does have the rent receipt issued by Sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta by him in property No.8A in file No.D/Tatar Pur, 5/80, dated 15.09.1980. It is wrong to suggest that my brother Sh. Subhash Chand Sharma deliberately under malafide intentions has not filed the rent receipts issued by Sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta to him in respect of property No.8A/12. I do not know if in the DDA papers C/o Sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta has been mentioned as I and my brother Sh. Subhash Chand was the tenant of Sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta in property No.8A/12, Tatar Pur, Delhi. In the year 1980 my brother Sh. Subhash get the electricity connection installed however the same was disconnected due to non-payment of electricity charges. Vol. The petitioner got the same disconnected due to concealing of electricity bill. A new electricity connection has been installed in the name of my another brother Sh. Avinash Chander. My brother Sh. Avinash Chander is aware of this case since the very inception of pendency of this case. Sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta never issued any rent receipt in the name of Sh. Avinash Chander and me. It is wrong to suggest that my brother Sh. Subash Chander and me had been the tenant of Sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta in respect of 25 sq. yard in property No.8A/12, Tatarpur. It is wrong to suggest that we under our malafide intentions have not filed the rent receipts in this case. It is wrong to suggest that I am deposing falsely.""
RW2 Sh. Subhash Chander in his evidence has deposed that:-

""The address which I have mentioned in the court in my examination in chief is not my residential address. E-668, Raghubir Nagar, New Delhi-27 is my residential address. The address 9/19, 8-A/12, Tatarpur, New Delhi-27 has been given by the father of the petitioner Sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta. I have filed the W.S in this case and I recognized my signature on the W.S at point A and point B. I do not know if the fact which I have mentioned in my affidavit Ex.RW2/A that I am in possession of 400 sq. yard has been mentioned in my W.S. or not. The witness has been shown his W.S. and after going through the W.S. it has been stated that still he does not know whether this fact has been mentioned in my W.S. or not. I do not know if the fact that the 400 sq. yards land situated at property No. 8-A, Tatarpur, Main Najafgarh Road, Tagore Garden, N.D is included 25 sq. yard which is subject matter of instant matter of eviction mentioned in my affidavit whether has been mentioned in my W.S. I do have the document of 400 sq. yards in my possession. I have not filed the said document in the court file. I have not mentioned anything in respect of said document in my W.S. The said document has been issued by the Court but I do not remember the designation of Hon'ble Court who issued the said document in the name of respondent no.1. It was the case of quarrel wherein the respondent no.1 and the petitioner were arrested. The said document was issued by that court. So far as my knowledge is concerned, my brother respondent no.1 have plead guilty and deposited the fine thereafter I do not know what happen in that case. I do not have any document in respect of the fact that 400 sq. yards was/is in my possession in Khasra No.9/19, 8-A/12, Tatarpur, Main Najafgarh Road, Tagore Garden, New Delhi-27. We entered in the suit property in the year 1980. I had taken the land in dispute from the father of the petitioner. Later on the DDA acquired the land after demolish the same. Suit property was also demolished. The incident of acquisition of the land as well as demolition is prior to 1980. The father of the petitioner had been issuing the rent receipts in my name. Sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta did not issue the rent receipt to me as DDA had demolished the premises in question. I also stopped paying the rent to the father of the petitioner after demolition of the property in question. The rent receipts issued by the father of the petitioner can not be available as by passage of time the same were got destroyed. I repossessed the property which was adjacent to the suit property. The property in repossession is included in property No.8-A, Tatarpur. After my repossession the father of the petitioner had instituted a law suit against me and respondent no.1 and in that proceedings the father of the petitioner had given the number of the suit property as 8-A/12. I can not tell whether the private number 8-A/12 given by the father of the petitioner was challenged by me. Vol. My brother/respondent no.1 can tell very fact. I do not remember the year and the relevant period when the father of the petitioner had instituted the law suit against us. I do not know what remained the fate of the case filed by the father of the petitioner. It is correct that I have no document issued by the DDA in which the suit property has been mentioned as 8- A/12, Tatarpur, Main Najafgarh Road. I have not filed any case against the father of the petitioner and after his death against the Legal heirs to declare that Sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta was not the owner of property no.8-A/12, Tatarpur. Even after receiving the RTI reply we did not file any case in the court seeking the declaration that Sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta was not the owner of suit property no.8-A/12, Tatarpur. We have filed an application before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India seeking the prayer to be impleaded as a party in the case pending before Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. The application was moved in the case titled as Sh. Jagdish Chander Vs Sh. Nand Ram. Again said Sh. Nand Ram Vs Sh. Jagdish Chander. I have not filed any application in subordinate courts in respect of the case pending in the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. I have not filed any case against Sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta whereby the rent receipts issued by sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta to us were sought to be declared null and void and without any power and capacity and without any ownership upon the suit property.....
..... The rate of rent was Rs.125/- p.m. in the rent receipts issued by the father of the petitioner to me and my brother the respondent no.1. I have not mentioned the fact in my W.S. that my brother Sh. Avinash Chander is also in possession of 400 sq. yard land in property No.8-A, Titarpur. I do not know if I have filed my W.S. in previous case pending between me and the petitioner bearing No. E- 203/2011 old No.E-3510/2010 titled as Subhash Chander Gupta Vs Ravi Kumar. My brother Sh. Avinash Chander knows about the present case pending in the court. I, my brother respondent no.1, has not filed any application for impleading my another brother Sh. Avinash Chander as a party. My brother Sh. Avinash Chander has also not filed any application in the court for impleading himself as a party in the petition. I have no document in respect of 400 sq. yard possession in Property No.8-A, Titar Pur. I have not filed any application in the Office of DDA/MCD or in any Govt. Office in respect of allotment of 400 sq. yard land situated in property No. 8-A, Titar Pur being in possession since 22.07.1980. We have not filed the rent receipts issued by the father of the petitioner to us in the office of DDA. In the year 1980 I was doing the work of scooter painting in premises in question. For the last 4/5 years I have changed my profession and at this time I am selling the tea in the premises in question. Though I had applied for registration of my profession of scooter painting but I do not have any document in this regard. One Sh. Manoj Kumar Sharma, Adv. is my nephew. It is wrong to suggest that I had sublet and part with possession of premises in question to Sh. Manoj Kumar Sharma, Adv. for his office. Vol. It is correct that Sh. Manoj Kumar Sharma, Adv. had affixed his sign board in the premises in question, however, there was no sub-letting. I do not know when Sh. Manoj Kumar Sharma, Adv. left the premises in question. The witness has been shown two photographs Ex.RW2/P1 and Ex.RW2/P2 in which the sign board of Sh. Manoj Kumar Sharma, Adv. Visibly seen and witness admitted the photographs to be related with the premises in question. The tyres seen in the photographs belongs to the petitioner. It is wrong to suggest that I and my brother sh. Ravi Kumar is the tenant of the petitioner in premises No.12 forming part of property No. 8-
A, Titar Pur, main Najafgarh Road, Tagore Garden, New Delhi. It is wrong to suggest that shop of the premises in question was constructed by the deceased father of the petitioner. It is wrong to suggest that we without written consent and permission of the father of the petitioner and the petitioner as well had sub-let the premises in question to several rickshaw owners and Sh. Manoj Kumar Sharma, Adv. It is wrong to suggest that we have neither paid nor tendered the rent to the petitioner and previously to the father of the petitioner when he was alive. It is wrong to suggest that despite the service of legal notice dated 13.01.2010 in previous eviction no. E-35/10 we did not pay the arrears of rent to the petitioner. It is further wrong to suggest that despite the service of legal notice dated 12.03.2013 we have neither paid nor tendered the arrears of rent to the petitioner. SDM Ram Pura did not pass any order to close the business/shop/premises in question. To my knowledge the appeal which was heard and adjudicated by Sh. Rakesh Siddharth, the then Ld. ADJ, Tis Hazari Courts, Delhi was against the order of SDM to continue and reopen the scrap business. The appeal pending in the Court of Sh. Rakesh Siddharth, the then Ld. ADJ, Delhi has been dismissed by that Hon'ble Court. It is wrong to suggest that I have deliberately not filed the rent receipt in this Court issued by the father of the petitioner in respect of the premises in question regarding my tenancy. It is wrong to suggest that we deliberately have not paid the arrears of rent to the petitioner and previously to his father despite the demand notices served upon us. I do not know if I have filed any law suit for declaration of ownership of the premises in question. It is wrong to suggest that I am deposing falsely.""
11. Perusal of testimony of respondent no. 2 Sh. Subhash Chander shows that during the cross examination, respondent no. 2 has admitted that the rate of rent was Rs. 125/- p.m. and the rent receipts were issued by the father of the petitioner Sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta to him and his brother Sh. Ravi Kumar/ respondent no. 1.

Moreover, perusal of document i.e. RW-1/2 (OSR) letter issued by the Estate Officer, DDA to Sh. Subhash S/o Mangal Dass dated 08.01.1981 clearly shows that ""C/O Jagdish Chand"" has been mentioned in such address i.e R/o 8A, Tatarpur, Najafgarh Road, New Delhi. The same position is there in respect of RW-1/3 (OSR) and RW-1/4 (OSR) as these documents also show the name of Jagdish Chand as C/o. Even during the cross-examination, respondent no. 1 and Respondent no. 2 could not explain the reasons of mentioning of name of Sh. Jagdish Chand on these documents.

Perusal of record shows that during the cross- examination, the stand of the respondent was that they are in possession of 400 square yards but respondents themselves has admitted during the cross-examination that there is no such plea taken by them in their written statement.

Moreover, cross-examination of the RW-1 Sh. Ravi Kumar also shows that he has not denied that in the DDA papers C/o Sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta has been mentioned as they were the tenant of Sh. Jagidsh Chand Gupta. Perusal of record also shows that rent receipt issued by Sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta has not been challeged by the respondents and this fact has been admitted by the respondents during the cross examination.

12. As such, perusal of record manifestly shows that there existed the relationship of landlord-tenant between Sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta and respondent and also after the death of Sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta, between the petitioner and respondents as it is undisputed fact that petitioner is the son of Sh. Jagdish Chand Gupta. Moreover, the petitioner has placed on record judgment passed by the then Ld. SCJ Sh. Lokesh Kr. Sharma and Tax Survey report Ex. PW-3/A (OSR) which also shows the respondent no. 2 Sh. Subhash Chander as tenant and Sh. Jagidsh Chand Gupta as Tax Payer.

It is well settled proposition of the law that the Rent Controller is not supposed to decide the title while dealing with the petitions under D.R.C. Act. This is the jurisdiction of the Civil Court concerned. Moreover, U/Sec. 14(1)(a) of D.R.C. Act, the petitioner is not required to prove his ownership. He merely has to prove his landlordship. Moreover, even under the petition U/Sec. 14(1)(e) of the D.R.C. Act, the petitioner/ landlord has to prove that he is something more than the tenant/respondent. He does not have to prove his ownership in absolute terms.

13. In the present case, the petitioner has been able to prove that he is landlord in respect of tenanted premises and he is something more than the tenant/respondent. As far as title of the tenanted premises is concerned, the Rent Controller cannot decide the title under D.R.C. Act. The parties may approach before the Appropriate Forum having jurisdiction.

14. In my considered view, in view of discussion as earlier, there exists relationship of landlord-tenant between the parties.

(ii). Service of Legal Demand Notice:-

15. Perusal of record shows that the petitioner has claimed to have given legal demand notice dated 12.03.2013 Ex. PW-1/2 through postal receipts Ex. PW-1/3.

On the other hand, the respondents have claimed to have not received such legal demand notice and further claimed that the petitioner has no right to claim such arrears of rent from the respondents.

It is well settled law that mere denial is not sufficient. It is pertinent to reproduce the section 27 of General clauses Act which is as under :-

Section-27--Meaning of service by post--where any central Act or Regulation made after the commencement of this Act authorizes or requires any document to be served by post, whether the expression ""serve"" or either of the expressions ""give"" or ""send"" or any other expression is used then, unless a different intention appears, the service shall be deemed to be effected by properly addressing, pre- paying and posting by registered post, a letter containing the document, and unless the contrary is proved, to have been effected at the time at which the letter would be delivered in the ordinary course of post.""
In the case titled as K. Bhaskaran vs. Sankaran Vaidhyan Balan 1999 A.I.R SC 3762, the Hon'ble Supreme court observed :-

""The principle incorporated in section 27 can profitably be imported in a case where the sender has dispatched the notice by post with the correct address written on it. Then it can be deemed to have been served on the sendee unless he proves that it was not really served and that he was not responsible for such non-service.""
Section 114 of Indian Evidence Act, 1972 lays down as under:-

114: Court may presume existence of certain facts. That the court may presume existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being head to the common course of natural events, human conduct and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.
Illustrations:
The court may presume-
(a)...
(b)...
(c)...
(d)...
(e)...
(f) That the common course of business has been followed in particular cases; -
(g)....
(h).....
(I).....
but the court shall also have regard to such facts as the following, in considering whether such maxim do or do not apply to the particular case before it:-""
As to illustration (a).....
As to illustration (b).....
As to illustration (c).....
As to illustration (d).....
As to illustration (e).....
As to illustration (f): The question is whether a letter was received. It is shown to have been posted, but the usual course of the post was interrupted by disturbances;
As to illustration (g).....
As to illustration (h).....
As to illustration (i)........""
16. It is well settled law that this presumption is a rebuttable presumption. If there is any such circumstance weakening such presumption, it cannot be ignored by the court. Moreover, presumptions U/Sec. 27 of General Clause Act and Sec. 114 of the Indian Evidence Act is always there to support the fact of service of such legal demand notice. Moreover, nothing concrete has been done by the respondents to rebut such presumption. Hence, service of legal demand notice as stipulated U/Sec. 14(1)(a) of D.R.C. Act is proved.

(iii). Non payment of rent:-

17. Perusal of record shows that in the present case, the petitioner has claimed the arrears of legally recoverable rent @ Rs. 125/- p.m. i.e. three years prior to filing of the petition.

On the other hand, the repondents have claimed that since the petitioner is not the landlord and the owner of the tenanted premises, they are not liable to pay or tender the rent to the petitioner.

This is not the case of respondents that they have paid or tendered the rent to the petitioner or deposited the rent with the court.

18. As discussed earlier exhaustively, the landlordship of the petitioner is already proved in the instant case. As such, this ingredient of non payment of arrears of legally recoverable rent within two months from the date of service of notice as provided U/Sec. 14(1)(a) of D.R.C. Act is also satisfied.

CONCLUSION :-

19. In view of the aforesaid discussion and settled proposition of law, this court has come to the conclusion that the petitioner has satisfied all the ingredients of Section 14(1)(a) of D.R.C. Act in respect of the tenanted premises i.e. private tin shed No. 12 measuring 25 sq. yards forming part of property No. 8-A, Tatarpur, Main Najafgarh Road, Tagore Garden, New Delhi as shown red in the site plan attached with the petition Ex. PW-1/1.

20. It is pertinent to mention that no order U/Sec. 15(1) D.R.C. Act was passed by the Ld. Predecessor or by this court. As such, in view of the material on record and discussion as earlier, an order U/Sec. 15(1) D.R.C. Act is passed directing the respondents to pay or tender or deposit the rent @ Rs. 125/- per month w.e.f. 12.07.2010 (Legally recoverable rent as the petition was filed on 12.07.2010) till date along with simple interest @ 15% p.a. within one month from the date of this order and they are further directed to pay or tender or deposit the future rent in favour of the petitioner at the same rate i.e. Rs. 125/- p.m. on or before the 15th day of each succeeding English calendar month.

21. Nazir is directed to file his report on 04.04.2020. regarding compliance of order U/Sec. 15(1) D.R.C. Act passed by this court today.

22. Miscellaneous file be prepared for ascertaining the benefits U/Sec. 14(2) of the D.R.C. Act.

23. It has been brought into the court that a costs of Rs. 8,000/- was imposed upon the respondents vide order dated 25.02.2020 with direction to deposit it with the DLSA by 4:00 p.m. on the same day but the same was not deposited within time and matter was reserved for judgment for 27.02.2020. But, it was brought into the notice of the court that it was deposited later on after the stipulated period time.

In my considered view, in the interest of justice, it should be refunded to the respondents in case it is deposited in compliance with the order dated 25.02.2020. Hence, costs of Rs. 8,000/- be refunded by the DLSA (West District), THC, Delhi in case it is deposited by the respondents on 26/27.02.2020.

24. It is pertinent to re-mention that although the present petition was filed U/S 14(1)(a)&(b) of DRC Act but on 15.02.2020, the relief U/S 14(1)(b) of DRC Act was withdrawn by the Ld. Counsel for the petitioner. As such, this court is not required to give the finding on U/S 14(1)(b) of DRC Act.

25. This file be consigned to Record Room after due compliance.

"A.S. Bopanna,J.

1. The appellants are before this Court assailing the order dated 31.07.2015 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in FAO No. 5704 of 2012 (O&M). Through the said order, the High Court has Signature Not Verified Digitally signed by MAHABIR SINGH remanded the matter to the sole Arbitrator Mr. Justice Date: 2019.12.03 17:47:00 IST Reason:

Kuldip Singh, retired Judge, Supreme Court of India for  providing opportunity of leading evidence to both the parties and also grant opportunity to crossÂ­examine the witnesses and thereafter decide each and every claim and counter claim separately on merits. The said order is passed in an appeal filed by the respondent herein under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (âAct 1996â for short). The appellant herein who was the respondent in the said appeal is therefore before this Court claiming to be aggrieved by the said order.

2. The brief facts leading to the present situation is that the appellants herein are joint owners of the land measuring 14 Kanals and 3 Marlas (8560 Sq. yards) situate at village Sunet, Tehsil and District Ludhiana, State of Punjab. The respondent company through its representatives claiming to be wellÂ­versed with construction and development of properties approached the appellants for joint venture in constructing a residentialÂ­cumÂ­ commercial complex on the subject land. Accordingly, an agreement dated 14.12.1996 was entered into and among other terms agreed therein, the respondent had undertaken  to complete the construction of the building consisting of at least six floors within three years from the date of obtaining the sanctioned plan from the Ludhiana Municipal Corporation. The project was required to be funded by the respondent and a sum of Rs. 45,00,000/Â­ (Rupees FortyÂ­ Five Lakhs only) was to be deposited with the appellant as a guarantee for completion of the project. In that view, the appellants were expected to retain the same if the building is not completed within the period of three years. The sale proceeds from the constructed building was to be shared in the ratio of 48:52 % between the appellants and the respondent.

3. Pursuant to such agreement the respondent secured the sanction of the building plan from the Municipal Corporation on 04.07.1997. The period of three years was to be computed from that point as per the agreement. Hence the construction ought to have been completed by 03.07.2000. According to the appellant, the respondent though commenced the construction during August, 1997, the activity was undertaken until 31.03.1999 and the  project was abandoned by them thereafter. Since the construction was not completed by 03.07.2000 and no further progress was made despite the appellant having waited beyond the said period, the appellants got issued a legal notice dated 01.11.2001 and terminated the agreement dated 14.12.1996. The respondent though issued reply dated 28.11.2001 did not proceed further to make progress in the construction.

4. The appellants further claim that in such circumstance the appellant and the respondent entered into a compromise and a cancellation agreement dated 26.10.2004 was executed due to which an amount of Rs. 40,00,000/Â­ (Rupees Forty Lakhs only) from the amount which was received as security deposit was returned. Notwithstanding the same, since there was change of guard in the composition of the management, the respondent filed an application under Section 9 of the Act, 1996 seeking to restrain the appellants from damaging or demolishing the construction which had been raised by the respondents. Immediately thereafter a notice dated 23.11.2004 was  issued by the respondent invoking the arbitration clause for referring the matter to arbitration. The Arbitration Case No. 124 of 2006 under Section 11 of the Act, 1996 filed by the respondent was allowed on 03.07.2009 and Mr. Justice Kuldip Singh, retired Judge, Supreme Court of India was appointed as the sole arbitrator to resolve the dispute between the parties.

5. In that view the parties appeared before the learned Arbitrator and filed their respective claim, counterÂ­claim and objection thereto. The evidence by way of affidavit and the documents of respective parties was also filed, where after the learned Arbitrator on hearing the learned counsel for the parties passed the award dated 13.01.2010 through which both the claim as well as the counter claim was dismissed. The respondent herein claiming to be aggrieved by the same filed a petition under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 in the Court of the Additional District Judge, Ludhiana which was registered in Arbitration Case No. 3 dated 29.01.2010. The learned Additional District Judge through the order dated 13.09.2012 affirmed the award by  dismissing the petition. It is in that view the respondent herein filed an appeal under Section 37 of the Act, 1996 before the High Court. The learned Single Judge of the High Court has arrived at the conclusion that the parties have not been granted appropriate opportunity by the learned arbitrator to tender evidence by examining witness and to crossÂ­examine the witnesses, whose affidavits were filed. It is further held by the High Court that the learned Arbitrator has not considered the aspect relating to the extent to which the construction was put up and the amount that was expended by the respondent herein and no determination, in that regard has been made. The said observation was made after holding, though the time was not the essence of the contract but yet the long delay would not be justified. It was held, even in that circumstance the other aspects required consideration. In that background the matter was remanded to the learned Arbitrator for fresh consideration.

6. Mr. Shyam Divan, learned senior counsel for the appellant while assailing such conclusion by the High  Court has taken us through the appeal papers and has referred to the agreement dated 14.12.1996 and the clauses governing the parties. It is contended that when a dispute is referred to the learned Arbitrator, Section 19 of the Act, 1996 provides that the Arbitrator can determine the rules of procedure. In that regard it is pointed out that in the hearing held on 28.11.2009 the learned Arbitrator has in the course of the proceedings finalised the procedure and recorded the same in the order. It is pointed out that the respondent was represented by a senior advocate in the arbitration proceedings wherein it has been agreed that the parties would rely upon the affidavits and documents that were filed and the procedure of crossÂ­examination could be dispensed. In that background the learned arbitrator has referred to the materials on record in the background of the claim put forth and the affidavits filed in support thereof while arriving at the conclusion. Hence, he contends that the procedural lapse as attempted to be made out at this stage is not justified.

 7. It is further contended by Mr. Shyam Divan that in a proceedings where the consideration ought to be limited to the extent provided under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 and when the learned Additional District Judge has in that light examined and confirmed the award, the consideration ought not to have been expanded by the learned Single Judge in a proceedings under Section 37 of the Act, 1996 wherein also the scope is limited. On the factual aspect it is contended that despite the terms agreed in the agreement dated 14.12.1996, no progress was made in the construction even until the point when the proceedings were initiated before the learned Arbitrator after it was abandoned in March 1999. In that circumstance when the learned Arbitrator has taken into consideration these aspects and arrived at the conclusion, the learned single judge could not have interfered with the award. The learned senior counsel in that regard has taken us through the award to point out that a detailed consideration has been made by the learned Arbitrator on all aspects including the fact that the cancellation of the agreement was agreed between the parties. On the contention urged  relating to the construction incurring an amount of Rs.1,22,00,000/Â­ (Rupees One Crore TwentyÂ­Two Lakhs only) said to have been made by the respondent also a consideration has been made. In that circumstance when the contention was adverted to and a view was taken by the learned Arbitrator based on a finding of fact, the learned Single Judge was not justified in commenting that the said aspect had not been adverted to by the learned Arbitrator. It is therefore contended that the award is liable to be sustained and the order passed by the learned Single Judge be set aside.

8. Mr. Shibo Shankar Misra, learned counsel for the respondent in his attempt to sustain the order passed by the learned Single Judge contends that the respondent had raised twelve claims before the learned Arbitrator and each claim should have been decided separately. It is his case that the learned Arbitrator has proceeded to reject the claim only on the conclusion that time is the essence of the contract. Though the terms as contained in the agreement dated 14.12.1996 is not disputed, the learned counsel  contends that the delay caused resulting in nonÂ­completion of the project is solely attributable to the appellant. The appellants had not parted with the title documents relating to the land in question due to which the respondent was not in a position to raise the funds from the bank by creating mortgage. Apart from the security amount the respondent has suffered loss to the extent of Rs. 1,22,00,000/Â­ (Rupees One Crore TwentyÂ­Two Lakhs only) being the cost of construction which was put up. Specific claim was raised under different heads before the learned Arbitrator. Despite such contentions and claims being put forth the learned Arbitrator has not considered the same. In that regard it is contended that clause 11 of the agreement which provides relating to the expenditure incurred has not been properly appreciated. The learned counsel contended that the learned Additional District Judge in the proceedings under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 has also not adverted to these aspects of the matter. However, the learned Single Judge taking note of these aspects and also keeping in view the decision in the case of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. vs. SAW Pipes  Limited 2003 (5) SCC 705 has arrived at the conclusion that an award of the present nature cannot be sustained and has accordingly remanded the matter to the learned Arbitrator to provide opportunity to the parties and take a fresh decision. It is contended that in such circumstance when both parties would have an opportunity, the appellant herein cannot make out any grievance. He therefore contends that the above appeal be dismissed.

9. In the light of the contentions put forth we have perused the appeal papers and made reference to the material on record. With regard to the agreement dated 14.12.1996 and the clauses contained therein to regulate the parties there is no serious dispute between the parties. The very fact that a contention has been raised by the respondent seeking to attribute the delay and the nonÂ­ completion of the project to the appellant by contending that the nonÂ­furnishing of the title documents had prevented the respondent from raising loan would by itself indicate that no progress was made except putting up the initial construction and the project was not completed  within the period of three years or thereafter, though the building plan was sanctioned on 04.07.1997. In that light the appellant had issued a notice dated 01.11.2001 and terminated the agreement, which had resulted in a dispute between the parties. In that background the matter was placed before the learned Arbitrator who had been appointed in a proceeding under Section 11 of the Act, 1996. A perusal of the award dated 30.01.2010 available at Annexure PÂ­12 to the appeal papers would indicate that a detailed consideration has been made by the learned Arbitrator on all aspects of the matter. In that background when the petition under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 was filed before the learned Additional District Judge, the learned Additional District Judge in fact has also adverted to all aspects of the matter and since no ground for interference as contemplated under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 was made out, the learned Additional District Judge through his order dated 13.09.2012 has upheld the award.

10. In that backdrop when the learned Arbitrator and the learned Additional District Judge have arrived at a  concurrent opinion, it is necessary for us to take note as to whether the learned Single Judge in an appeal filed under Section 37 of the Act, 1996 could have adverted into the merits of the contention beyond the scope available under Section 34 (2) of the Act, 1996 so as to set aside the award and remand the matter. In that regard whether the contentions which were put forth to assail the award by picking holes in the procedure adopted by the learned Arbitrator is to be accepted or not also requires examination, keeping in view the scope of Section 34 (2) of the Act, 1996 and determine as to whether such ground is made out.

11. Since the learned Single Judge has presently accepted the contention raised on behalf of the respondent herein that the procedure followed by the learned Arbitrator is contrary to law and has prejudiced the respondent herein since the witnesses were not crossÂ­examined, this aspect of the matter is required to be noticed at the outset. As rightly pointed out by the learned senior counsel for the appellant, the rules of procedure to be followed by an  Arbitral Tribunal is flexible and can be agreed upon by the parties as provided under Section 19 of the Act, 1996 which reads as hereunder;

19. Determination of rules of procedure â (1) The arbitral tribunal shall not be bound by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) or the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872).
(2) Subject to this Part, the parties are free to agree on the procedure to be followed by the arbitral tribunal in conducting its proceedings.
(3) Failing any agreement referred to in subÂ­section (2), the arbitral tribunal may, subject to this Part, conduct the proceedings in the manner it considers appropriate. (4) The power of the arbitral tribunal under subÂ­section (3) includes the power to determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of any evidence.
12. Further, keeping in view that the contention put forth before the High Court by the respondent herein to assail the award was in the manner as noticed above with regard to the appropriate procedure not being followed and there being denial of opportunity and in that view the respondent not being able to put forth the case appropriately before the learned Arbitrator, the effect of the same is required to be examined. When a challenge is raised on that ground, in our opinion it would at best fall under Section 34 (2) (a) (iii) which reads as follows;  â34. Application for setting aside arbitral award â (1) Recourse to a Court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in accordance with subÂ­section (2) and subÂ­section (3).

(2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court only ifâ

(a) the party making the application furnishes proof thatâ

(i) xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

(ii) xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

(iii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; orâ (emphasis supplied) Therefore, in order to consider whether the challenge is sustainable on the ground available in law, at the outset it is necessary to examine whether the procedural lapse if any is committed by the learned Arbitrator in unilaterally denying the opportunity to the parties so as to make the award invalid and to set aside the same exercising the power under Section 34 or in an appeal under Section 37 of the Act, 1996. In this regard as noticed, Section 19 of the Act, 1996 provides that the Arbitral Tribunal is not bound by the Code of Civil Procedure or the Indian Evidence Act. Further, it provides that the parties are free to agree on the procedure to be followed by the Arbitral Tribunal. In this back drop it is noticed that in the case on hand, in the proceedings dated 28.11.2009 (Annexure  PÂ­15) before the learned Arbitrator, the procedure to be followed has been discussed and recorded, which reads as hereunder;

âThe parties and their learned counsel have been heard. Whatever further pleadings, documents and list of witnesses were to be filed by the parties in terms of the proceedings dated 10.10.2009, have been done. The evidence of the claimant as well as of the respondents was to be recorded today. Mr. Ram Lal, whom the respondents want to crossÂ­examine, is present before the Arbitrator.
The learned counsel for the parties have, however, agreed and consented before me they do not wish to crossÂ­ examine any of the witnesses whose affidavits have been filed by the parties concerned. In view of the consent of the learned counsel of the parties and parties themselves who are present, I close the evidence. The parties will rely on the affidavits already filed and the documents and other pleadings already placed on the record.â (emphasis supplied) That apart by the very proceedings dated 28.11.2009 the points on which arguments would be addressed were also treated as the issues for consideration and has been formulated and recorded in the order sheet.

13. From a perusal of the proceedings dated 28.11.2009 it would be clear that both contentions raised by the learned counsel for the respondent herein and which were accepted by the learned Single Judge to ultimately remand the matter, would not be justified. Firstly, in the presence of the parties and their learned counsel it has been  recorded that they do not wish to crossÂ­examine any of the witnesses whose affidavits have been filed by the parties concerned and one of the witness who was present was discharged without being cross examined and no grievance was made either by the parties or their learned counsel who were present. It is in that view the evidence was taken as closed on 28.11.2009 and the issues for consideration was settled for arguments on the same day. In that circumstance having consented to the said procedure, it would not be open for the respondent herein to approbate and reprobate so as to raise a different contention at this point. Having accepted the said procedure the respondent is estopped from raising such contention before the learned Single Judge that the arbitrator misconducted himself by not permitting the parties to crossÂ­examine the witness and also that the learned Arbitrator being more than 70 years of age and suffering from knee problem has pressurized the respondent to speed up the matter and the evidence was closed. It is rather intriguing for us to note that such contention has not only been permitted to be raised, but  also accepted by the learned Single Judge to remand the matter, which is wholly unjustified.

14. We are of such opinion for the reason that the procedure to be followed in arbitration proceedings was settled by a separate order dated 28.11.2009 during the course of the proceedings before the learned Arbitrator. Thereafter the award was passed only on 13.01.2010. Though the respondent was represented by their learned counsel and the order dated 28.11.2009 was passed while recording the proceedings of that day, neither any application had been filed before the learned Arbitrator to recall the said order and provide opportunity to tender evidence or cross examine, nor was a challenge raised by initiating any other proceedings, before the award was passed. It is only subsequent to the award being passed such contention is being raised as an afterthought, which in such event cannot be accepted. That apart, the agreement being entered into on 14.12.1996 and the work not having progressed subsequent to March,1999 was not seriously in dispute and in that circumstance based on  the affidavit, the admitted documents have been taken note by the learned Arbitrator due to which the nonÂ­crossÂ­ examination in any event has not prejudiced the respondent herein. One aspect of the matter no doubt was with regard to the claim that was put forth by the appellant herein that a cancellation agreement dated 26.10.2004 was entered into and the security deposit of Rs. 40 Lakhs and the advance of Rs. 23 Lakhs has been reÂ­paid to Mr. S. Surinder Singh which was disputed by the respondent. On that aspect the learned Arbitrator in any event has concluded that the said payment if any cannot be considered as a payment made to the respondent company but has been received by Mr. Surinder Singh who had made gain unto himself. In such event since the respondent has not filed the affidavit of Mr. Surinder Singh disputing the same, it is an interÂ­se matter to claim from Mr. Surinder Singh and therefore, the nonÂ­ crossÂ­examination on that aspect also has not resulted in any prejudice. Be that as it may, as already taken note, the procedure to be followed in the arbitral proceedings  has been agreed to by the parties. Hence the respondent cannot be heard to complain as and when it suits them.

15. Further, since through the very order dated 28.11.2009 the issues for consideration on which the arguments would be addressed was settled and the matter was proceeded on that understanding without raising any objection, the grievance put forth by the respondent and accepted by the learned Single Judge that the learned Arbitrator has not answered each of the claims separately in the award, cannot also be accepted. A perusal of the award would indicate that the learned Arbitrator has adverted to all aspects in a sequential manner and has recorded his conclusion in answer to the contentions that were put forth.",ld
"JUDGMENT N.L. Untwalia, J.

1. This is an appeal by special leave arising out of a land acquisition proceeding. The land measuring 28 bighas and 18 biswas situated within the municipal limits of the town of Muzaffarnagar in the State of Uttar Pradesh was sought to be acquired by a notification issued on the 25th November, 1948 under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act. The land was needed for the Muzaffarnagar Housing Cooperative Sociely. Out of the acquired are a of the land a portion measuring 1 bigha and 4 biswas belonged to one Uggra Sen; the rest belonged to appellant Deep Chand. The total area belonging to the said appellant (hereinafter in this judgment he alone will be referred to as the appellant) was 67, 872 sq. yards. Out of this, land measuring 61, 012 sq. yards was in possession of the tenants and the balance 6, 860 sq. yards was in khas possession of the appellant. The appellant in the year 1942 pursuant to an agreement of sale executed by his vender had purchased the land @ 2 annas per sq. yard. But there was a lot of litigation between the parties as a subsequent purchaser came into the scene and ultimately the appellant succeeded in this Court in getting the land after a lot of expenses. The Collector's award determined the compensation payable at 2 annas per sq. yard. Reference were asked for by the appellant, the tenants as else by said Uggra Sen. Uggra Sen had purchased his land by sale deed dated May 15, 1946 Ext. 7 @Rs. 1/6/per sq, yard. In his reference the District Judge allowed him compensation at the said rate and since the amount involved in his case was small, he did not go up in appeal to the High Court. The learned District Judge of Muzaffarnagar who decided the reference fixed 6 anaas per sq. yard as the value of the appellant's land both in his khas possession and in possession of his tenants. The value of 61,02 sq. yards of tenants land at the said rate came to Rs. 22,869/8/- and the share of appellant Deep Chand @ 10 annas in a rupee was fixed at Rs. 14,296/11/- and that of the tenants at 6 annas in a rupee came to Rs. 8,579/13. The value of 6,860 sq. yards of Khuskasht of the appellant at 6 annas per sq. yard came to Rs. 2,572/8/-. Thus the total value to which the appellant was held entitled came to Rs. 16, 872/3/. Adding 15% to this amount the total amount payable to Deep Chand came to Rs. 19.403/-. Deducting the amount already awarded by the Collector the balance payable under the judgment of the District Judge came to Rs. 9, 525/7/-. It was directed that he was entitled to get interest @ 6% per annum from the date of his dispossession i.e. 1st May, 1951 to the date of payment.

2. An appeal was taken to the High Court from the decision of the District Judge. Although the appellant had claimed in the reference the value of the land @ Rs. 6/- per sq.yard. in appeal the total extra claim was limited to Rs. 1,25,000/- over and above the sum of Rs. 19.403/- determined by the District Judge as the sum payable to the appellant. In other words, roughly speaking, in the High Court the appellant confined his claim as regards the value of the land to Rs. 2/12/- per sq. yard claiming the full amount for his Kbudkasht land and 10 annas in a rupee in respect of the tenants' land. On that basis adding 15% the total claim came to Rs. 1,44,403/-thus the value of the appeal was confined to Rs. 1,25,000/ only.

3. The High Court has dismissed the appeal of the appellant in toto. In our opinion it was a fit case where the appeal ought to have been substantially allowed and by committing obvious error in appreciation of the legal position and the facts and circumstances of the case the High Court maintained the valuation fixed by the District Judge.

4. The site plan which is a part of the record of the case shows that the land in question is situated to the North of Bhopa Bijnor Road and to the East of the Railway line which runs North to South crossing the said road at a point which is near Plot No. 110 to its West and Plot No. 220 to its East. The main Basti is to the West of the Railway line. But more and more land were required for building purposes due to the extension of the town as also due to influx of a large number of refugees from Pakistan in the year 1947. They came to the town of Muzffarnagar in large numbers. At the relevant time the land to the East of the Railway line was mostly agricultural and there was little habitation. Very near the North of the land there was a bungalow of Church Mission Society, It will appear from the Society's application dated March 11, 1947 as also from the report of the Sub-Divisional Officer who was the Land Acquision Officer that the land was class to the inhabited area of New Mandi and was the best of all other available lands from the point of its hygienic conditions and healthy enviranments, The Sub-Divisional Officer had summed up his report thus:

...I have come to the conclusion that due to the acute housing problem in this thickly populated town which is not only a big commercial and business center of the western districts of U.P. but has also attracted substantially a large number of refugees there is a great dearth of houses and the acquisition of the land in question is essential as it is just in the heart of ever growing locality of this town....

5. As noticed by the High Court the land had certain disadvantages also. The level of the land was lower than the level of the Bhopa Road: during rainy season water collected on it. There were some pits here and there, which needed filling up. Nonetheless the value fixed by the Courts below, in our judgment is too and unjust. If these defects would not have been there the value of the land would have been not less than Rs. 5/- per sq. yard. In any event we shall immediately show that the value cannot be less than Rs. 2/6/- per sq. yard.

6. The market value of the land had to be fixed as prevailing on the date of the notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, which as already stated, was issued on November 25; 1948. It would appear from the site plan that Uggra Sen's land was not abutting the Bhopa Road although it was near it. It was land looked as it was surrounded on all sides by the appellant's land in question. Uggra Sen had purchased his land by Ext. 7 the sale deed dated 15-5-1946 @ Rs. 1/6/- per sq. yard. We find from the records that land comprised in plot No. 110 which is adjacent west to the Railway line was purchased by sale deed dated 15-6-1945 Ext. 11 @ Rs. 5/- per sq. yard. It was resold by sale deed dated 4-10-1948 Ext. 12 - Rs. 10/- per sq. yard. It would thus be seen that the price of the land in the locality was doubled in the course of three years near about the time the notification under Section 4 had been issued. Thus the value of the land in question could be taken at Rs. 2/12/- per sq. yard on the basis of Uggra Sen's sale deed. But we are taking not the double figure because the doubling of the price in regard to plot No. 110 was in respect of a land which was to the west of the Railway line. Ext. 40 is a sale deed dated 15-2-1947 which is in respect of a small piece of land to the South of the Bhopa Road but very near the land in question. This sale deed shows the sale price of the land at Rs. 10/- per sq. yard. We leaving this sale deed out of consideration ,as the area covered by it very small being only 424 sq. yards. But the High Court was not right in completely brushing aside the sale deed dated 11.3.1948. Ext. 9 by which about 5 bighas of land in plot no 220 was sold approximately @ Rs. 7/- per sq. yard. This sale deed has been rejected on the ground that plot No. 220 is near the Railway crossing, it contained a mango grove and that It was a small plot compared to the land in question. We are not impressed by any of these reasons. Since the plot is to the east of the Railway line its nearness to the Railway crossing cannot bring about a huge difference in value in comparison with the appellant's land. So also the existence of the mango grover cannot justify the large difference between Rs. 7/- per sq. yard and 6 annas per sq. yard. It is not a small plot of land. Although it is smaller in area than the appellant's land, yet it is big enough for throwing light on the prevailing market value of the land in the locality at the relevant time.

7. Appellant Deep Chand was Vice-President and Secretary of S.D. College, Muzaffarnagar. For the purpose of the College a large chunk of his land situated further east was acquired in the year 1955. The appellant agreed before the Acquisition Officer to accept the price of the land for the purpose of the College @ 5 annas per sq. yard. This seems to have heavily weighed , with the Courts below in fixing 6 annas per sq. yard as the value of the land in question. But in our opinion wrongly. The appellant and family were interested in the establishment of the College. Deep Chand was the Vice President and the Secretary Obviously, therefore, he therefore, he accepted a nominal price by way of compromise before the Land Acquisition Officer as a good gesture and benevolent disposition. He did contest the valuation matter nor did he ask for any reference. In respect of the land in question he had already started making his claim by way of reference and claimed Rs. 6/- per sq. yard. It does not stand to reason, therefore, that he would accept 5 annas per sq. yard for the College land thinking that was the proper market value of the land in or about the year 1955.

8. For the reasons stated above we fix the market value of the land in question prevailing at the relevant time at Rs. 2/6/- per sq. yard that is to say the appellant is entitled over and above the amount fixed by the District Judge an extra rate of Rs. 2/- per sq. yard. In respect of his land. The value of his Khuskasht land measuring 6,860 sq. yards will be Rs. 13, 720/-. The value of 61,012 sq. yards, the tenants land, will be Rs. 1,22,024/-. Calculating it at the rate of 10 annas in a rupee the value of the appellant's share will be Rs. 76,265/-. The total value of this land thus comes to Rs. 89,985/-. Solatium of 15% on the said amount comes to Rs. 13,497/75 paise. Thus the total extra amount awarded by us over and above the amount awarded by the Courts below comes to Rs. 1,03,482. 75 paise. Thus the total extra amount awarded by us over and above the mount awarded by the Courts below a comes to Rs. 1.03,482.75 paise. The appellant will be entitled to interest on this amount also @ 6% per annum from the date of dispossession i. e. 1st may, 1951 till the date of payment. The appeal is accordingly allowed in part and the judgments of the Courts below are modified. The appellant will also be entitled to get his proportionate costs in the High Court as also in this Court.",ld

                                                   JUDGMENT
R.F. Nariman, J.

1. This appeal raises a question as to the correct interpretation of Section 14(1)(d) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as âthe Codeâ). The facts necessary to appreciate the setting in which this question arises are as follows:

i. On 01.11.2007, a Resolution bearing No.6280 was passed by the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (hereinafter referred to as âthe MHADAâ) to execute a joint development agreement with the Corporate Debtor, i.e. Guru Ashish Construction Private Limited, and Goregaon Signature Not Verified Digitally signed by SUSHMA KUMARI Siddharth Nagar Sahakar Griha Nirman Sanstha Limited (a BAJAJ Date: 2020.02.26 11:26:33 IST Reason:
Society for persons who are displaced and who are to be re-
housed in the project for joint development of land, ad-
 measuring about 40 acres), which envisaged re-development insofar as 672 tenements in Siddharth Nagar, Goregaon, Mumbai were concerned.

ii. On 03.03.2008, the Maharashtra State Government granted its approval to the aforesaid Resolution.

iii. On 10.04.2008, a Tripartite Joint Development Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the âJoint Development Agreementâ) was entered into between the Society representing persons occupying 672 tenements, MHADA and the Corporate Debtor.

iv. On 25.03.2011, a Loan Agreement was entered into and executed between the Union Bank of India and the Corporate Debtor for a sum of Rs. 200 Crores.

v. On 09.11.2011, a Deed of Modification was entered into between the three parties to the Joint Development Agreement, as after carrying out the survey of the land in question, it was found that certain parcels of land, which were identified with certain city survey numbers, were omitted, as a result of which they were also added, now making the project for a total of 47 acres of land.

vi. As a result of the Corporate Debtor defaulting in repayment of the loan to its financial creditor, namely, the Union Bank of  India, an Insolvency Application under Section 7 of the Code, which was filed on 15.05.2017, was admitted on 24.07.2017, appointing an Interim Resolution Professional (i.e. the Appellant before us). A moratorium in terms of Section 14 was also declared by this order.

vii. On 12.01.2018 - after the imposition of the moratorium period under Section 14 of the Code - MHADA issued a termination notice to the Corporate Debtor stating that upon expiry of 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice, the Joint Development Agreement as modified would stand terminated. It was further stated that the Corporate Debtor would have to handover possession to MHADA, which would then enter upon the plot and take possession of the land including all structures thereon.

viii. One hundred and eighty days from the start of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (hereinafter referred to as âthe CIRPâ) expired on 19.01.2018. The NCLT, by order dated 24.01.2018, extended the CIRP period by ninety days, as is permissible under the Code.

ix. On 01.02.2018, the Appellant filed M.A. No. 96 of 2018, seeking a direction from the NCLT to restrain MHADA from taking over possession of the land till completion of the CIRP,  contending that such a recovery of possession was in derogation of the moratorium imposed under Section 14 of the Code. The NCLT, by order dated 02.04.2018, dismissed the aforesaid application, stating that Section 14(1)(d) of the Code does not cover licenses to enter upon land in pursuance of Joint Development Agreements, stating that such licenses would only be âpersonalâ and not interests created in property. An appeal against this order was preferred to the NCLAT.

x. Meanwhile, in a parallel proceeding, on 18.04.2018, the amount of time taken by the NCLT in deciding the application under Section 7 under the Code, being 55 days, was sought to be omitted from the total number of days allowable under the Code. This application was partially granted, excluding 38 out of 55 days. An appeal to the NCLAT proved successful, whereby the NCLAT, by order dated 09.05.2018, allowed the appeal and allowed the entire 55 days so taken before the NCLT to be excluded.

xi. On 03.07.2018, the Appellant filed an approved Resolution Plan before the NCLT, Mumbai by way of I.A. No.21433 of 2018. We are informed that this was within the extended period of 55 days so granted by the NCLAT. It may only be  mentioned that the Resolution Plan was approved by 86.16% of the Committee of Creditors. Ultimately, the NCLAT, by the impugned order dated 14.12.2018, (after omitting to refer to the order dated 09.05.2018), stated that 270 days are over, as a result of which the entire discussion of Section 14(1)(d) would now become academic. However, it also decided:

â14. On perusal of record, we find that pursuant to the âJoint Development Agreementâ the land of the âMaharashtra Housing and Area Development Authorityâ was handed over to the âCorporate Debtorâ and âexcept for development workâ the âCorporate Debtorâ has not accrued any right over the land in question. The land belongs to the âMaharashtra Housing and Area Development Authorityâ which has not formally transferred it in favour of the âCorporate Debtorâ. Hence, it cannot be treated to be the asset of the âCorporate Debtorâ for application of provisions of Section 14(1)(d) of the âI&B Codeâ.â
2. Mr. Dhruv Mehta, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the Appellant, has taken us through the Joint Development Agreement together with the Deed of Modification in great detail. His first submission is that it would be wholly incorrect to state that a mere âlicense to enterâ had been granted. According to him, if these two documents were read as a whole, it is clear that legal possession was actually handed over to him in order to do three things: (1) construct tenements which were to be handed over to MHADA free of cost; (2) construct tenements in which the 672 occupiers of the erstwhile tenements were to be housed; and (3) thereafter recoup costs and make profit by sale of what was called the âfree sale componentâ that would be left over. Apart from the above, he went through the NCLT order dated 02.04.2018 in great detail, and stated that there is a conceptual confusion in the said order, inasmuch as Section 14(1)(b) of the Code was not the subject-matter of consideration, in which case it would have been necessary to see other sections dealing with âassetsâ that pertain to the Corporate Debtor, such as Sections 18 and 36 of the Code. If Section 14(1)(d), on the other hand, were to be seen, it does not mention the expression âassetsâ at all but only refers to âpropertyâ, which according to Mr. Mehta was defined extremely widely. He argued that, in any event, on the plain language of Section 14(1)(d), it was not necessary for him to make out any case as to legal possession having been handed over to him, as the expression used by Section 14(1)(d) and applied to the facts of his case is ââ¦ is occupied byâ.

He argued that applying the latin maxim reddendo singula singulis, it is clear that any recovery of a property by an owner where such property is âoccupied byâ the Corporate Debtor would clearly fall within Section 14(1)(d), the expression â...or in the possession ofâ going with the expression âlessorâ and not âownerâ. This being the case, he contended that it is clear that when two expressions of different import are used within the same sub-section, they are meant to mean different things. The expression âoccupiedâ would have to be confined to physical occupation or use, and not to legal possession, which is a separate concept in law. He cited a number of authorities to buttress his arguments.

3. Mr. Dushyant Dave, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of MHADA, painstakingly took us through the various provisions of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Act, 1976 (hereinafter referred to as the âMHADA Actâ). He relied, in particular, upon the various clauses in the preamble and then referred to Sections 4, 5, 37, 66 and 74 and relied strongly upon Sections 76 and 79 of the MHADA Act to argue that joint development schemes that the Authorities concerned enter into with the builders must first be with the previous approval of the Authority, and such schemes have to be executed under the supervision of the Authority. This being the case, according to him, there is no question of any possession or occupation being handed over and, as a result, Section 14(1)(d) of the Code would not apply. He also strongly relied upon a recent judgment by my brother S. Ravindra Bhat, J. in Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) vs. Abhilash Lal & Ors. (Civil Appeal No. 6350 of 2019), to buttress his proposition that Section 238 of the Code, which contains a non-

obstante clause getting out of harmâs way other statutes, cannot be extended beyond the provisions of the Code. He exhorted us to give full play to the MHADA Act, and if that were done it is obvious that any clash between the MHADA Act and the Insolvency Code would then have to be resolved, at least on the facts of this case, in favour of MHADA. He also referred to a Bombay High Court order dated 05.04.2018, in which it was stated that MHADA had taken symbolic possession on 05.04.2018.

4. Mr. Basava Prabhu Patil, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of some of the homebuyers, also referred to and relied upon the judgment of my brother S. Ravindra Bhat, J. Both Mr. Dave and Mr. Patil referred to and relied upon a recent judgment of this Court in Sushil Kumar Agarwal vs. Meenakshi Sadhu and Others (2019) 2 SCC 241 in which, in the context of specific performance, development agreements were categorized into three types, and it was stated that where interests in property were not created by any category, such agreements could not be specifically performed.

5. Having heard the learned senior counsel appearing for all the parties, it is necessary to first set out some of the provisions of the Code. Section 3(27) reads as follows:

â3. Definitions. In this Code, unless the context otherwise requires,â xxx xxx xxx  (27) âpropertyâ includes money, goods, actionable claims, land and every description of property situated in India or outside India and every description of interest including present or future or vested or contingent interest arising out of, or incidental to, property;â Section 14 is set out as follows:
â14. Moratorium.
(1) Subject to provisions of sub-sections (2) and (3), on the insolvency commencement date, the Adjudicating Authority shall by order declare moratorium for prohibiting all of the following, namely:â
(a) the institution of suits or continuation of pending suits or proceedings against the corporate debtor including execution of any judgment, decree or order in any court of law, tribunal, arbitration panel or other authority;
(b) transferring, encumbering, alienating or disposing of by the corporate debtor any of its assets or any legal right or beneficial interest therein;

(b) a surety in a contract of guarantee to a corporate  debtor.
(4) The order of moratorium shall have effect from the date of such order till the completion of the corporate insolvency resolution process:
Provided that where at any time during the corporate insolvency resolution process period, if the Adjudicating Authority approves the resolution plan under sub-section (1) of section 31 or passes an order for liquidation of corporate debtor under section 33, the moratorium shall cease to have effect from the date of such approval or liquidation order, as the case may be.â (emphasis supplied) Section 18, on which great reliance is placed, is also set out hereunder:

â18. Duties of interim resolution professional. (1) The interim resolution professional shall perform the following duties, namely:â
(a) collect all information relating to the assets, finances and operations of the corporate debtor for determining the financial position of the corporate debtor, including information relating toâ

(i) assets over which the corporate debtor has ownership rights which may be located in a foreign country;

(ii) assets that may or may not be in possession of the corporate debtor;

(iii) tangible assets, whether movable or immovable;

(iv) intangible assets including intellectual property;

(v) securities including shares held in any subsidiary of the corporate debtor, financial instruments, insurance policies;

(vi) assets subject to the determination of ownership by a court or authority;

(g) to perform such other duties as may be specified by the Board.

Explanation.âFor the purposes of this section, the term ""assets"" shall not include the following, namely: â

(a) assets owned by a third party in possession of the corporate debtor held under trust or under contractual arrangements including bailment;

(b) assets of any Indian or foreign subsidiary of the corporate debtor; and

(c) such other assets as may be notified by the Central Government in consultation with any financial sector regulator.â Section 31 which indicates the period of moratorium is also important and is set out as follows:

â31. Approval of resolution plan.
(1) If the Adjudicating Authority is satisfied that the resolution plan as approved by the committee of creditors under sub-section (4) of section 30 meets the requirements as referred to in sub-section (2) of section 30, it shall by order approve the resolution plan which shall be binding on the corporate debtor and its employees, members, creditors, including the Central Government, any State Government or any local authority to whom a debt in respect of the payment of dues arising under any law for the time being in force, such as authorities to whom statutory dues are owed, guarantors and other stakeholders involved in the resolution plan:

Provided that the Adjudicating Authority shall, before passing an order for approval of resolution plan under this sub-section, satisfy that the resolution plan has provisions for its effective implementation. (2) Where the Adjudicating Authority is satisfied that the resolution plan does not confirm to the requirements referred to in sub-section (1), it may, by an order, reject the resolution plan.

(3) After the order of approval under sub-section (1),-

(a) the moratorium order passed by the Adjudicating Authority under section 14 shall cease to have effect; and

(b) the resolution professional shall forward all records relating to the conduct of the corporate insolvency resolution process and the resolution plan to the Board to be recorded on its database. (4) The resolution applicant shall, pursuant to the resolution plan approved under sub-section (1), obtain the necessary approval required under any law for the time being in force within a period of one year from the date of approval of the resolution plan by the Adjudicating Authority under sub-section (1) or within such period as provided for in such law, whichever is later:

"Appeal by special leave from the judgment and Order dated January.31, 1961 of the Calcutta High Court, in Civil Rule No. 2112 of 1957.

Arun Kumar Dutta and D. N. Mukherjee, for the 'appellants.

S. M. Bose,Advocate-General for the State of West Bengal, S. C. Bose andP. K. Bose, for the respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Sarkar, J. In this case the validity of the West Bengal Land .(Requisition and Acquisition) Act, 1948 was questioned by the ,appellants by a petition moved under Art. 226 of the Constitution in the High Court at Calcutta. The High Court having dismissed the petition, the appellants have filed this appeal with special leave granted by this Court. The Act provided for requisition and also for acquisition of ,land by the . State Government ""for maintaining supplies and services essential to the life of the,community or for providing ,proper facilities for transport, communication, irrigation or drain.age,, or-for the creation of better living conditions in rural or ,urban areas........ by the construction or reconstruction of. dwelling places for, people residing in such areas."" The Act ;provided for payment of 'compensation in respect of requisition and acquisition made under it.

An, order was made under, the Act on July 22, 1957 requi- tioning certain lands belonging to one of the appellants, the other ,appellant being, a lessee thereof, and it was stated in the order that possession would be taken on August 2, 1957. Thereupon the apperants filed the petition. The appellants challenged the validity of Act in the High

-Court on various grounds. In this Court however only , one ground was advanced in support of the appeal and that alone, therefore, we are called upon to discuss in this judgment. It was said that the Act offended Art. 1 9 ( I ) (f ) of the ConsTitution as it put unreasonable restrictions on the right to hold property. I The High Court had rejected this contention on the round- that this Court had decided in Babu Barkya Thakur v. The State of Bombav(1) that an Act providing for acquisition of property by the State could not be attacked for the reason that it offended Art. 19(1) (f). It also held that the decision in Kavalappara Kochuni v. The State of Madras(2) did not bold that Art. 31(2) of the Constitution does not exclude the applicability of Art.: 19(1)(f). We think that the High Court was right on both these points. Obviously, what was said in Babu Barkya Thakur's case(1) about a law relating to acquisition of property by the State would apply t lo a law relating to requisition. It would follow that the validity of the Act cannot be questioned ,on the ground that it offends Art. 19(1) (f).

(1)[1961] 1 S.C.R.128.

(2) [1961]3 S.C.R. 887.

The learned advocate for the appellants contended that the decisions of this Court earlier mentioned were in conflict with each other and that the later decision, namely, that in Babu Barkya Thakur's case(1) concerning the applicability of Art. 19 (I) (f) to a law of requisition or acquisition by the State covered by Art. 31(2) had been based on two earlier decisions of this Court, namely, The State of Bombay v. Bhanii Munji(1) and Lila-vati Bai v. The Siate of Bombay(',), both of which must, in view of the decision in Kavalappara Kochuni's(4) case, be deemed to have lost their authority after the Constitution (Fourth Ai-nendmerit) Act, 1955. It was pointed out that in Kavalappara Kochuni's case (4 ) it was said that Bhanji Alunji's(2) case ""no longer holds the field after the Constitution, (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955 The same observation, it was contended, would also apply to the case of Lilavati Bai v. The State of Bombay(- ').

It is true that Bdbu Barkya Thakur's, case(1) in so far as it dealt with Arts. 19(1) (f) and 31(2), was based on Bhanji Munji's case(2) and Lilavati Bai's case(3) both of which had been decided on Art. 31 as it stood prior to the aforesaid amendment of the, Constitution.. It is also true that both these cases dealt with a statute giving power to the, State to requisition land and held that such a law if valid under Art. 31 as it stood before the amendment, would not be void on the ground, that it infringed Art. 19(1)(f). Now, before the amendment it had been held by this Court by a majority-Das J., as he then was, alone taking a different view-that both cls. (1) and (2) of Art. 31 dealt with a law giving power to the State to acquire or requisition property. Kavalappara Kochuni's case(4) held that after the amendment, cl. (2) of Art. 31 alone dealt with acquisition and requisition of property by the State and cl. (1) dealt with deprivation of property in other ways. This case did not deal with a law of acquisition or requisition of property by the State but was concerned with a law by which deprivation of property was brought about in other ways, which law, it held, had to satisfy Art. 19 and the principle in Bhanji Munji's(2) case which could have saved that law before the amendment could not save it after the amendment. The observation in Kavalappara Kochuni's(4) case that Bhanji Miinji's (2 ) case ""no longer holds the field""'has, there- fore, to be understood as meaning that it no longer governs a case of deprivation of property by means other than requisition and acquisition by the State. Kavalappara Kochuni's case(4 ) was not concerned with a law of requisition or acquisition. It was not directly concerned with the question whether Bhanji Munji's (1) [1961] 1 S.C.R. 128. (2) [1955] 1 S. C.R. 777. (3) [1957] S.C.R. 721. (4) [196 ]1 3 S. C.R . 887.

case(1) would not after the amendment, apply even to a law requisition or acquisition of Property governed by Art. 31(2) as it now stands, and did not decide that question. Indeed it might be said- that the reasoning 'in so I me passages of the judgment in the Kavalappara(2) decision would appear to suggest that a law providing for ""acquisition"" and ""requisition"" by the State as understood in the sense indicated by Art. 31(2) (a), does not fall within Art. 19(1) (f) and that the validity of such a law is not to be tested by the criterion in Art. 19(5). Otherwise the point made in it regarding the disseverance effected between the content 'of Art. 31(1) and of Art. 31(2) by the Fourth Amendment would lose all significance. It would therefore appear that there is nothing in that case which would bring into any conflict with Babu Barkya Thakur's(3) case. As the only ground on which the correctness- of the decision in Babu Barkya Thakur's, case(3) was challenged was that it was inconsistent with Kavalappara Kochuni's case(2), that argument must fail.

The appeal, therefore, fails and is dismissed with costs.

"SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.

1. The Agriculture Department of the Government of Sikkim (respondent No.2) sought to acquire, in the year 1980, land measuring 8.36 acres, located in Dundung Block, Sang in East Sikkim for the purpose of building the Progeny Orchard Regional Centre. The land was recorded in two names â 1.29 acres in the name of the Maharaja of Signature Not Verified Digitally signed by ASHA SUNDRIYAL Date: 2020.03.02 16:21:35 IST Sikkim and 7.07 acres in the name of Man Bahadur Basnett, father of the Reason:

original appellant. The latter land is subject matter of dispute in the present proceedings.

2. The land in question is partially fenced, with a farm, some barracks and office. Late Man Bahadur Basnett passed away in the year 1991 whereupon the property fell to the share of the appellant in the present proceedings (now represented by his two sons). It may be noticed that Man Bahadur Basnett was survived by seven (7) children, but there is no dispute inter se the siblings in respect of the claim of D.B. Basnett over suit property.

3. It is the case of the late appellant that when he visited the suit property in March, 2002, he found that the respondents had wrongly encroached and trespassed on the same, using it as an agricultural farm. He claims to have lived away from Gangtok earlier and thus, served a notice on 5.4.2002 under Section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 notifying them against the alleged trespass and seeking possession. There was no response to the same and, thus, the suit was filed before the Court of District Judge (E&N), Gangtok, Sikkim, being the Title Suit No.6/2004 (renumbered) on 9.12.2002.

4. The sum and substance of the claim made was that the procedure envisaged under the Sikkim Land (Requisition and Acquisition) Act, 1977 (hereinafter referred to as the âsaid Actâ) had not been invoked or followed. Suffice to say that the process is similar to the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as the â1894 Actâ), i.e., notification required under Section 4 of the Act for acquisition of land, opportunity to interested persons to file claims under Section 5 of the Act and the determination of the amount of compensation under Section 7 of the Act. The plea raised was that no notice of acquisition was ever published, nor any process followed for the same.

5. Respondent No. 2 sought to raise a defence to the suit of the bar of limitation. It is their say that the Agriculture Department had followed due process while acquiring the land in 1980 and had paid compensation of Rs.62,645 to late Man Bahadur Basnett through the Land Revenue Department. Thus they were enjoying peaceful possession of the subject matter property as a consequence thereof. The claim of the late appellant that rent was being paid to the Government was stated not to be in the knowledge of the Agriculture Department.

6. The trial court dismissed the suit vide judgment and order dated 31.10.2006, both on grounds of limitation as well as substantive merits. The consideration of merits was based on the fact that the original stamped receipts of payment of compensation had been taken note of in the record of proceedings, though the actual receipt was not available. The correspondence exchanged even inter-departmentally was stated to point to the compensation being paid, as also a letter which had been sent by late Man Bahadur Basnett, signifying his consent to transfer suit property upon payment of due compensation.

7. On appeal being filed and registered before the High Court of Sikkim, being RFA No.2/2007, the same was examined on both issues and was dismissed on 29.5.2008. However, insofar as the aspect of limitation was concerned, the High Court disagreed with the findings of the trial court by relying upon Article 65 of the Limitation Act, 1963, which provided for a period of twelve (12) years in case of adverse possession. Such a case of adverse possession was opined to be difficult for the State Government to plead and in any case, on facts, had never been pleaded. It is also recorded that no notification under the said Act had been produced, nor was any record produced in that behalf. The actual signed and stamped receipts were also not placed on record. The inconsistent stand of the Government claiming that they had acquired the land while still collecting land revenue for the same was also noted. These aspects were sought to be balanced with the letter dated 20.3.1980, of late Man Bahadur Basnett, who had given his no objection to the acquisition if compensation was paid to him, and a letter dated 2.4.1980 of the Land Revenue Department forwarding the compensation to the District Collector for payment to late Man Bahadur Basnett. The land revenue records were stated not to be of such significance in the face of these documents, but sympathising with the predicament of the appellant and recognising the weaker position of the Government in the entire dispute, it was observed that the Government had no justification to keep holding on to the land revenue as collected from the appellant. Since no claim was made in that behalf, it was directed that the same should be refunded, if so asked for by the appellant, more so as the Government has to act as a âmodel litigant.â

8. In the SLP filed against the impugned order, leave was granted on 7.1.2011. The matter was, however, taken up for hearing for the first time on 2.5.2019. On hearing learned counsel for the parties, at the request of the learned counsel for the respondents, time was given to scrutinize the record and show to the Court how a sum of Rs.62,645 was withdrawn by the Collector in cash (as alleged and as contended), and which document(s) evidenced payment to late Man Bahadur Basnett. It was observed that this was the least expected considering that the respondents claimed to have lost all records of acquisition proceedings and none of the notifications were available. The order ended by observing that a failure to show the same would necessitate the State Government to acquire the land through fresh notification, if it wants to keep the land.

9. An affidavit was filed in August, 2019, which was analysed on 27.8.2019, and it was found that there was neither any proof of the Collector having withdrawn cash to the tune of Rs.62,645 from the account, nor any receipt from late Man Bahadur Basnett acknowledging the payment, except the stated covering letter for the receipt. In the conspectus of these facts, in order to work out a mutually agreed settlement, the dispute was referred to the Mediation Centre annexed to the High Court of Sikkim. Unfortunately this also did not produce any result, a failure report was received and, thus, the remaining arguments were heard.

10. We may notice that though leave was granted, no cross-objections were filed by the respondents on any aspect including on the finding of limitation.

11. Be that as it may, the fact remains, as noticed by the High Court, that it is not the case of the respondents that they had adverse possession, but that they had acquired the land through due process and had paid compensation for the same. We agree with the High Court that there is no plea even of adverse possession by the respondent. We are not to be detained by the same in this appeal.

12. We are in complete agreement with this view and for this reason also the plea of adverse possession really does not survive.

13. That brings us to the question whether the process of acquisition had been followed in accordance with law. No notification has been shown to us of the intent to acquire land under Section 4, or any other declaration thereafter. In fact what is claimed before us, as also before the courts below, is that no records are available in respect of the acquisition process. This obviously puts the respondent State in a difficult situation, which was sought to be got over by only relying on a consent having been obtained for acquisition and the compensation having been paid, as determined. On the aspect of the compensation, only a covering letter is available, and not the actual receipt. We have also observed aforesaid that an unusual process of making payment in cash is claimed to have been adopted, and the amount is not an insignificant amount, if we look at the year of acquisition. We even gave a further opportunity to the authorities to show, as to from which account this compensation was withdrawn by the Collector, but it appears that there is no proof even of the withdrawal of the amount, much less payment of the compensation. The letter dated 20.3.1980 of late Man Bahadur Basnett is no doubt a no- objection to the acquisition of land, but provided compensation was paid subsequently. This letter does not obviate the need to furnish proof of the process for acquisition of land or for the determination of compensation, under the said Act. There cannot be a presumption of acquisition without following the due process as envisaged under Sections 3(1), 4(2), 5(1) and 7(2) of the said Act. The burden was on the State to prove that the process as envisaged under the said Act was followed and the compensation paid. Not an iota of evidence has been laid in support of any of these aspects, except the willingness of late Man Bahadur Basnett to permit the land to be acquired on payment of compensation, the forwarding of the amount by the Land Revenue Department to the District Collector through a cheque, and thereafter a letter from the Collector/respondent No.1 stating that some receipt was being enclosed, acknowledging the payment in cash (without a receipt being found). There is, thus, absence of both primary and secondary evidence.

14. We may note that even though rights in land are no more a fundamental right, still it remains a constitutional right under Article 300A of the Constitution of India, and the provisions of any Act seeking to divest any person from the rights in property have to be strictly followed1.

1N. Padmamma & Ors. v. S. Ramakrishna Reddy &Ors. (2008) 15 SCC 517
15. It is also settled law that following the procedure of Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 18942 (akin to Section 5(1) of the said Act) is mandatory, and unless that notice is given in accordance with the provisions contained therein, the entire acquisition proceeding would be vitiated. An entry into the premises based on such non-compliance would result in the entry being unlawful3. The law being ex-propriatory in character, the same is required to be strictly followed. The purpose of the notice is to intimate the interested persons about the intent to acquire the land. These provisions, as they read, of the said Act, thus, are also required to be so followed.

16. We find a detailed discussion about the law as it evolved and the rationale for the said purpose in Vidya Devi4 of which the relevant paragraphs read as under:

â10.1. The Appellant was forcibly expropriated of her property in 1967, when the right to property was a fundamental right guaranteed by Article 31 in Part III of the Constitution.
2Publication of Preliminary Notification and Powers of Officers thereupon. 3Narinderjit Singh & Ranjit Singh & Ors. v. State of U.P. &Ors., Etc. (1973) 1 SCC 4(supra) Article 31 guaranteed the right to private property (The State of West Bengal v. Subodh Gopal Bose and Ors. AIR 1954 SC 92), which could not be deprived without due process of law and upon just and fair compensation.

10.2. The right to property ceased to be a fundamental right by the Constitution (Forty Fourth Amendment) Act, 1978, however, it continued to be a human right (Tukaram Kana Joshi & Ors. v. M.I.D.C. & Ors. (2013) 1 SCC 353) in a welfare State, and a Constitutional right under Article 300A of the Constitution. Article 300 A provides that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law. The State cannot dispossess a citizen of his property except in accordance with the procedure established by law. The obligation to pay compensation, though not expressly included in Article 300A, can be inferred in that Article (K T Plantation Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Karnataka (2011) 9 SCC 1).

To forcibly dispossess a person of his private property, without following due process of law, would be violative of a human right, as also the constitutional right under Article 300 A of the Constitution.

Reliance is placed on the judgment in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. v. Darius Shapur Chennai (2005) 7 SCC 627,wherein this Court held that:

â 6. â¦ Having regard to the provisions contained in Article 300A of the Constitution, the State in exercise of its power of ""eminent domain"" may interfere with the right of property of a person by acquiring the same but the same must be for a public purpose and reasonable compensation therefor must be paid.â (emphasis originally supplied) In N. Padmamma v. S. Ramakrishna Reddy (2008) 15 SCC 517, this Courtheld that:
â21. If the right of property is a human right as also a constitutional right, the same cannot be taken away except in accordance with law. Article 300A of the Constitution protects such right. The provisions of the Act seeking to divest such right, keeping in view of the provisions of Article 300A of the Constitution of India, must be strictly construed.â (emphasis originally supplied) In Delhi Airtech Services Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. State of U.P.& Ors. (2011) 9 SCC 354, this Court recognized the right to property as a basic human right in the following words:
â30. It is accepted in every jurisprudence and by different political thinkers that some amount of property right is an indispensable safeguard against tyranny and economic oppression of the Government. Jefferson was of the view that liberty cannot long subsist without the support of property."" Property must be secured, else liberty cannot subsist"" was the opinion of John Adams. Indeed the view that property itself is the seed bed which must be conserved if other constitutional values are to flourish is the consensus among political thinkers and jurists.â (emphasis originally supplied) In Jilubhai Nanbhai Khachar v. State of Gujarat, (1995) Supp. 1 SCC 596 this Court held as follows:
â48. â¦In other words, Article 300A only limits the powers of the State that no person shall be deprived of his property  save by authority of law. There has to be no deprivation without any sanction of law. Deprivation by any other mode is not acquisition or taking possession under Article 300A. In other words, if there is no law, there is no deprivation.â (emphasis originally supplied) 10.3. In this case, the Appellant could not have been forcibly dispossessed of her property without any legal sanction, and without following due process of law, and depriving her payment of just compensation, being a fundamental right on the date of forcible dispossession in 1967.
10.4. The contention of the State that the Appellant or her predecessors had âorallyâ consented to the acquisition is completely baseless. We find complete lack of authority and legal sanction in compulsorily divesting the Appellant of her property by the State.

10.5. In a democratic polity governed by the rule of law, the State could not have deprived a citizen of their property without the sanction of law. Reliance is placed on the judgment of this Court in Tukaram Kana Joshi &Ors. v. M.I.D.C. &Ors. (2013) 1 SCC 353 wherein it was held that the State must comply with the procedure for acquisition, requisition, or any other permissible statutory mode. The State being a welfare State governed by the rule of law cannot arrogate to itself a status beyond what is provided by the Constitution.

This Court in State of Haryana v. Mukesh Kumar held that the right to property is now considered to be not only a constitutional or statutory right, but also a human right. Human rights have been considered in the realm of individual rights such as  right to shelter, livelihood, health, employment, etc. Human rights have gained a multifaceted dimension.â

17. There is also a discussion in the judgment on the aspect of delay and laches, which is as under:

â10.7. The contention advanced by the State of delay and laches of the Appellant in moving the Court is also liable to be rejected. Delay and laches cannot be raised in a case of a continuing cause of action, or if the circumstances shock the judicial conscience of the Court. Condonation of delay is a matter of judicial discretion, which must be exercised judiciously and reasonably in the facts and circumstances of a case. It will depend upon the breach of fundamental rights, and the remedy claimed, and when and how the delay arose. There is no period of limitation prescribed for the courts to exercise their constitutional jurisdiction to do substantial justice.
In a case where the demand for justice is so compelling, a constitutional Court would exercise its jurisdiction with a view to promote justice, and not defeat it (P.S. Sadasivaswamy v. State of T.N. (1975) 1 SCC 152).
In Tukaram Kana Joshi &Ors. v. M.I.D.C. &Ors. (2013) 1 SCC 353, this Court while dealing with a similar fact situation, held as follows:
âThere are authorities which state that delay and laches extinguish the right to put forth a claim. Most of these authorities pertain to service jurisprudence, grant of compensation for a wrong done to them decades ago, recovery of statutory dues, claim for educational facilities and other categories of similar cases, etc. Though, it is true that there are a few authorities that lay down that delay and laches debar a citizen from seeking remedy, even if his fundamental right has been violated,  under Article 32 or 226 of the Constitution, the case at hand deals with a different scenario altogether. Functionaries of the State took over possession of the land belonging to the Appellants without any sanction of law. The Appellants had asked repeatedly for grant of the benefit of compensation. The State must either comply with the procedure laid down for acquisition, or requisition, or any other permissible statutory mode.â (emphasis originally supplied)
18. The aforesaid legal principles do not leave the respondents with any defence in the given facts of the case.
19. The result of the aforesaid would be that the respondents have failed to establish that they had acquired the land in accordance with law and paid due compensation. The appellant would, thus, be entitled to the possession of the land as also damages for illegal use and occupation of the same by the respondents, at least, for a period of three (3) years prior to the notice having been served upon them. We are strengthened in our observations on account of the judgment of this Court in LAO v. M. Ramakrishna Reddy,5 where it was held that the owner can be entitled to damages for wrongful use and possession of land in respect of which no notification is issued under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, from the date of possession till the date such notification is finally published. 5(2011) 11 SCC 648
20. We are conscious that the land is being used by the respondent- State through respondent No.2 Department. That, however, does not give such a license to the State Government. We had endeavoured to refer the matter for mediation, to find an amicable solution, but that did not fructify. We, however, would like to give some time to the respondent- State to analyse the consequences of this judgment, and, in case they so desire, to acquire the land through a proper notification under the said Act, and to take proper recourse in law so as to enable them to keep the land. We grant three (3) monthsâ time from the date of the judgment for the respondent-State to make up their mind as to what they want to do. Would they still like to retain the land by issuing a proper notification, or would they like to surrender possession of the land. In either eventuality, the question of payment for use and occupation would still arise, which will have to be determined in accordance with law. Mesne profits would be determined by a Court Commissioner, to be appointed by the trial court, as a relief in that behalf has been sought in the plaint itself.

21. In view of the aforesaid order, the alternative direction passed by the appellate court to refund the land revenue in case of a claim would not arise.

22. The appeal is accordingly allowed, leaving the parties to bear their own costs.",ld

Introductory

1. These appeals are essentially directed against the common order dated 01.08.2019 as passed by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi1 in a batch of appeals preferred by various banks and financial institutions whereby, the Appellate Tribunal set aside the order dated 16.05.2018, passed by the Adjudicating Authority, the National Company Law 1 Hereinafter also referred to as âthe Appellate Tribunalâ or âNCLATâ Tribunal, Allahabad Bench2 on the application moved by the Interim Resolution Professional3 in the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process4 concerning the Corporate Debtor Company viz., Jaypee Infratech Limited5 seeking avoidance of certain transactions, whereby the corporate debtor had mortgaged its properties as collateral securities for the loans and advances made by the lender banks and financial institutions to Jaiprakash Associates Limited 6, the holding company of JIL, as being preferential, undervalued and fraudulent, in terms of Sections 43, 45 and 66 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 20167.

1.1. It may be noticed at the outset that the batch of appeals decided by the impugned common order dated 01.08.2019 also comprised of two appeals filed by the lenders of JAL, being Comp. App (AT) (Ins) No. 353 of 2018 and Comp. App (AT) (Ins) No. 301 of 2018 that were preferred against the orders passed by NCLT on 09.05.2018 and 15.05.2018 respectively, whereby NCLT approved the decision of IRP rejecting the claims of such lenders of JAL to be recognized as financial creditors of the corporate debtor JIL on the strength of the mortgage created by the corporate debtor, as collateral security of the debt of its holding company JAL. These two appeals also came to be allowed as per the result recorded in the impugned order dated 01.08.2019, though the 2 Hereinafter also referred to as âthe Tribunalâ or âNCLTâ or âthe Adjudicating Authorityâ. 3 âIRPâ for short.

4 âCIRPâ for short.

5 âJILâ for short; also referred to as âthe corporate debtorâ. 6 âJALâ for short.

7 Hereinafter also referred to as âthe Codeâ or âIBCâ.

entire discussion and the final conclusion therein had only been in relation to the order dated 16.05.2018 that was passed by NCLT on the application for avoidance filed by IRP. The appellant of Civil Appeal D. No. 32881 of 2019 8, IIFCL, apart from raising other contentions, has also questioned this aspect of the order impugned that the aforesaid two appeals, involving the question as to whether the lenders of JAL could be categorised as financial creditors of JIL for the purpose of IBC, have been allowed by NCLAT without recording any findings and without any discussion in that regard.

Brief Outline and the Issues Involved

2. Before proceeding further, we may draw up a brief outline of the subject- matter and the issues involved in these appeals.

2.1. As shall be noticed hereafter later, the CIRP concerning the corporate debtor JIL has already undergone several rounds and circles of proceedings in NCLT, NCLAT and at least twice over in this Court.

2.2. For what has been indicated in the introduction, it is evident that two major issues would arise in these appeals. One, as to whether the transactions in question deserve to be avoided as being preferential, undervalued and fraudulent, in terms of Sections 43, 45 and 66 of the Code; and second, as to whether the respondents (lender of JAL) could be recognized as financial creditors of the corporate debtor JIL on the strength of the mortgage created 8 Now numbered as Civil Appeal Nos. 009357-77 of 2019 by the corporate debtor, as collateral security of the debt of its holding company JAL.

2.3. For a preliminary insight into the first issue, suffice would be to notice that during CIRP, the Interim Resolution Professional preferred an application before the Adjudicating Authority seeking orders for avoidance of the impugned transactions, whereby several parcels of land were put under mortgage with the lenders of JAL, the holding company of JIL. The contention of IRP, that the transactions in question were preferential, undervalued and fraudulent within the meaning of Sections 43, 45 and 66 of the Code, were accepted in part by the Adjudicating Authority, the NCLT, in its order dated 16.05.2018 and necessary directions were issued for avoidance of at least six of such transactions. In other words, in relation to such six transactions, the security interest was ordered to be discharged and the properties involved therein were vested in the corporate debtor, with release of encumbrances. The NCLAT, however, took an entirely opposite view of the matter and upturned the order so passed by NCLT, while holding that the transactions in question do not fall within the mischief of being preferential or undervalued or fraudulent; and that the lenders in question (the lenders of JAL) were entitled to exercise their rights under the Code. Aggrieved, the IRP, one of the creditors of the corporate debtor JIL and the associations of home buyers, who have invested in the proposed projects of JIL and JAL, have preferred these appeals.

2.4. As regards the second issue, noticeable it is that during CIRP, two of the respondent banks namely, ICICI Bank Limited and Axis Bank Limited, sought inclusion in the category of financial creditors of JIL but IRP did not agree and declined to recognize them as such. Being aggrieved by the decisions so taken by IRP, the said banks preferred separate applications under Section 60(5) of the Code before NCLT while asserting their claim to be recognized as financial creditors of the corporate debtor JIL, on account of the securities provided by JIL for the facilities granted to JAL. The NCLT rejected the applications so filed by the said banks, by way of its orders dated 09.05.2018 and 15.05.2018 respectively, while concluding that on the strength of the mortgage created by the corporate debtor JIL, as collateral security of the debt of its holding company JAL, the lenders of JAL could not be categorised as financial creditors of JIL for the purpose of the Code. As already noticed, the appeals against the said orders dated 09.05.2018 and 15.05.2018 are purportedly allowed as per the result recorded in the impugned order dated 01.08.2019, but without any discussion in that regard. Aggrieved, one of the lenders of the corporate debtor JIL, IIFCL (appellant of Civil Appeal D. No. 32881 of 2019) has also questioned this aspect of the order impugned while asserting that such mortgagees cannot be taken as financial creditors of the corporate debtor JIL.

Parties and their respective roles and interest in the matter

3. In view of the issues arising for determination in these appeals, with several parties carrying different roles, status and interests, worthwhile it would be to narrate at the outset, in brief, the relevant particulars of the key parties involved as follows:

3.1. Jaypee Infratech Limited (JIL):

It is the corporate debtor company in whose relation CIRP is pending; and the mortgage transactions concerning its properties were questioned in the application filed by the Interim Resolution Professional. Such transactions form the subject-matter of these appeals.

3.2. Jaiprakash Associates Limited (JAL):

It is the holding company of JIL; it had approximately 71.64% equity shareholding in JIL as on 31.03.2017. The impugned mortgage transactions were entered into in favour of its lenders.

3.3. Shri Anuj Jain:

He is the Interim Resolution Professional in CIRP concerning JIL who moved the application for avoidance of the transactions in question. He is the appellant in Civil Appeal Nos. 8512-27 of 2019.

3.4. Jaypee Greens Krescent Home Buyers Welfare Association; Jaypee Kasa Isles Welfare Association; Jaypee Kensington Boulevard Apartments Welfare Association; Garden Isle Welfare Association; Jaypee Klassic Apartment Welfare Association; Jaypee Kube Buyers Welfare Association; Wish Town Property Owners Welfare Society; KRH Buyers Association ABL Workplace:

They are the associations of home buyers who have invested in the projects of JIL and JAL. They are the appellants in Civil Appeal Nos. 6777-97 of 2019; and they also support the assertion of IRP that the transactions in question cannot be countenanced.

3.5 India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited:

It is the financial creditor of the corporate debtor JIL and has filed Civil Appeal in Diary No. 32881 of 2019 while asserting that the transactions in question need to be avoided; and that the lenders of JAL related with such transactions cannot be the financial creditors of JIL for the purpose of CIRP in question.

3.6 Axis Bank Limited; Standard Chartered Bank Limited; ICICI Bank Limited; State Bank of India; United Bank of India; UCO Bank; The Karur Vyasa Bank (P) Limited; L&T Infrastructure Finance Company Limited; Central Bank of India; Canara Bank; Karnataka Bank Limited; IFCI Limited; Allahabad Bank; Jammu & Kashmir Bank; South Indian Bank Limited; Bank of Maharashtra and other banks and financial institutions:

They are the lenders of JAL in whose favour the properties of JIL were put under mortgage by way of the impugned transactions. They oppose the assertions of appellants while maintaining that the transactions in question are not avoidable and are valid, investing them with the capacity of financial creditors of JIL. They are the principal contesting respondents in these appeals.

The transactions in question

4. Having taken note of the principal contesting parties and their respective interests, it would also be worthwhile to take note of the relevant particulars of the properties and the transactions involved in this dispute. It may be usefully noticed that out of seven transactions that were questioned by IRP, the Adjudicating Authority held that six of them were preferential, undervalued and fraudulent and passed the orders for their avoidance while accepting the contentions of IRP. It may also be observed that five out of these six transactions were preceded by previous mortgage transactions for securing the loans/facilities to JAL. The transactions in question, with previous transactions and flow thereof, as given out during the course of submissions, could be comprehensively viewed as under: -

2.

3. Dr. Chandra Prakash, IPS (Retd.) the plaintiff before this Court is fighting a dual battle for his honour and life. Dr. Chandra Parkash has knocked the doors of the Court on being aggrieved by a sting operation purported to be conducted by Aniruddha Bahal, wherein Rohtas Singh made defamatory statements and which formed the basis of an article captioned as ""Cops gave '84 rioters free hand: Sting, Seniors did not allow Cops to open fire"" published in the Times of India, Delhi Edition on 22.04.2014. Dr. Chandra Prakash has sought damages to the tune of â¹15,00,000/- (Rupees Fifteen lakhs only) jointly and severally from the Aniruddha Bahal (defendant No.1), Rohtas Singh (defendant No. 2) and Arindem Sen Gupta, Editor, Times of India (defendant No. 3) 3. Pleadings

4. The case urged by the plaintiff in his plaint is that he retired on superannuation on 30.11.2011, as an officer from the Indian Police Services (IPS) from the cadre of Union Territories now known as Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Mizoram and Union Territories Cadre).

5. The plaintiff was posted as Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) of the South district during the time when the tragic communal riots broke in Delhi in the wake of the assassination of late Prime Minister of India, Smt. Indira Gandhi on 31.10.1984.

3 Arindem Sen Gupta died during the pendency of the legal proceedings and the suit against him was abated - vide order dated 20.05.2016 Page No. 3/107

6. The plaintiff has averred that shortly after the riots, Mr. Ved Marwah, IPS, who was in central deputation at the time of occurrence of the riots was brought to Delhi police by the Congress government by the then Commissioner of police. Mr. Marwah was appointed to head the inquiry committee to enquire into the occurrence of 1984 riots. It is averred by the plaintiff that the whole effort was to protect that the riots were a mere administrative failure without involvement of any political party and political leaders.

7. During the course of inquiry, the plaintiff on 15.02.1985 sent a report as being the DCP, South district, which went against the scheme of things. Thereafter, Mr. Marwah set on a course to destroy the credibility of the plaintiff and started bringing false evidence on record in his inquiry against the plaintiff. It is averred by the plaintiff that a separate defamation suit was filed by him in the year 1995 before the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi and subsequently on enhancement of pecuniary jurisdiction the same was transferred to the district court at Tis Hazari, Delhi. It is averred by the plaintiff that the said suit is at its final stages.

8. As per the averments made in the plaint, the defendant No. 1, namely, Aniruddha Bahal (hereinafter ""defendant No. 1"") is a journalist, who claims to be engaged in sting operations. The defendant No. 2, namely, Rohtas Singh (hereinafter ""defendant No. 2"") was the then station house officer (SHO) of police station Delhi Cantonment situated within the South district, which was headed by the plaintiff and the Page No. 4/107 largest number of deaths in the South district occurred in the jurisdiction of the police station headed by defendant No. 2. It is averred by the plaintiff that he as the DCP, South district suspended defendant No. 2 for dereliction of duty pending departmental inquiry against him sometime around mid-November 1984. The defendant No. 3, namely, Arindem Sen Gupta (hereinafter ""defendant No. 3"") editor of the Times of India, Delhi Edition, who is stated to have published the impugned news article/report dated 22.04.2014.

9. The plaintiff has further averred in the plaint that the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 in collusion made defamatory imputations against him. It is also averred by the plaintiff that the defendant No. 3 did not publish his version despite the plaintiff having requested him by letters dated 08.05.2014 and 27.05.2014. It is also averred by the plaintiff that the legal notice dated 15.05.2014 issued by him to the defendant No. 3 was not paid heed by the defendant No. 3.

10. The plaintiff has averred that the impugned news report/article published in the newspaper Times of India, Delhi Edn. has portrayed him as a police officer, who acted in violation of duty casted on him by law and who failed to maintain law and order. It is also averred by the plaintiff that the allegations made against him in the impugned news article/report depicted him as a police officer who can tamper with official records to suit his personal interest, a conduct unbecoming of a public officer. The plaintiff has further averred that the imputations casted against him are bound to arouse resentment, condemnation and Page No. 5/107 lower the plaintiff's estimation in others. It is averred by the plaintiff that the allegations against him are highly defamatory.

11. The plaintiff has averred in the plaint that the allegations made by defendant No. 2 against him were motivated, malicious, false, baseless and not in good faith. It is further averred by the plaintiff that to his knowledge, the defendant No. 2 prior to 09.05.2011 did not make any allegations against the plaintiff even before any departmental/government authorities, inquiry committees and inquiry commission(s) all the way from Marwah Inquiry Committee appointed in November 1984 to the Nanavati Commission in the year 2000.

12. The plaintiff has averred in the plaint that similar kind of allegations were made against him by one sub-inspector Ramesh Rana, who was posted under defendant No. 2 at the police station Delhi Cantonment during the 1984 riots. It is averred by the plaintiff that during the course of statutory departmental inquiry held against him in the year 1998, after recording of evidence, the credibility of sub- Inspector Rana was rated as nil and the inquiry report was submitted by the commission of inquiries to the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, which was the cadre controlling authority as the plaintiff was an Indian police officer under their command and control.

13. The plaintiff has averred that shortly after the riots in the month of November 1984, he suspended sub inspector Ramesh Rana and the defendant No. 2 pending departmental inquiry, as there were reports against them for reporting very less number of killings in the police Page No. 6/107 station Delhi Cantonment under their jurisdiction, through wireless message as compared to the actual number of killings after first day of rioting. It is further averred by the plaintiff that the killings on the later days could have been averted by deploying additional resources had defendant No. 2 not resorted to underreporting of killings.

14. The plaintiff on 28.04.2014 got the legal notice issued to defendant No. 2 calling upon him to deny the false allegations made against the plaintiff and also tender an unqualified public apology through media by 12.05.2014. It is further averred by the plaintiff that in case the defendant No. 2 decides to stick to his guns of the false allegations and fails to produce genuine and cogent evidence in support of his allegations, the plaintiff intends to file civil and criminal proceedings of defamation and other related offences in appropriate court of law at the risk of defendant No. 2. It is averred by the plaintiff that a copy of notice dated 28.04.2014 was also issued to defendant No. 1 for necessary action, as per the notice.

15. The plaintiff has averred that he never received any response from defendant Nos. 1 and 2 to his notice dated 28.04.2014 by 12.05.2014. It is also averred by the plaintiff that meanwhile it came to his notice that defendant No. 1 had also published the false and baseless offending material on the website of Cobrapost. The plaintiff has averred that in view of the allegations interspersed with anchor's indecently abusive and unjustifiably defamatory comments, a supplementary legal notice dated 15.05.2014 was issued to defendant Page No. 7/107 No. 1. It is averred by the plaintiff that in his supplementary legal notice he had stated that the so-called ""sting"" was carried out and published not to serve any public good but to earn fat money by illegitimate means at the opportune time of General Elections 2014.

16. The plaintiff has averred in the plaint that the defendant No. 1 chose defendant No. 2, who had animus and grudge against the plaintiff. It is further averred by the plaintiff that the defendant No. 2 had an old axe to grind with him and was hellbent to lower the estimation of the plaintiff in the eyes of the public at large and damage his credibility and reputation. It is further averred by the plaintiff that the defendant No. 1 manipulated everything to make the story more sensational and saleable.

17. The plaintiff in paragraph No. 13 of the plaint has averred that it was common knowledge that as far as South district was concerned, the highest number of deaths of victim community, as per the Nanavati Commission report were 341 in the area of police station under the jurisdiction of defendant No. 2. The plaintiff has further averred that according to the Nanavati Commission Report, there was not even a single death in various other police stations situated in South district, such as Nizamuddin, Lodhi Colony, Defence Colony, Sarojini Nagar (earlier known as Vinay Nagar). It is averred by the plaintiff that the allegations levelled by defendant No. 2 are false, as the other police stations within the jurisdiction did not permit law and order situation to slip through hands and saved loss of life and property but it was the police station under the jurisdiction of defendant No. 2 where maximum Page No. 8/107 loss of lives and property occurred. The plaintiff has averred that where on one hand nine police stations other than the police station Delhi Cantonment could contain the loss of life and property, the spread of virus and the blame cannot be casted upon the DCP. It is averred by the plaintiff that the source of mischief, negligence would be the local station house officer of that particular police station i.e. SHO, P.S. Delhi Cantonment, Rohtas Singh. The plaintiff has further averred that it is a mystery that how defendant No. 1 believed the version of defendant No.2 as gospel truth. The plaintiff has averred that if defendant No. 2 had made some incriminating statements against him in unguarded moments during the so-called sting, it could have some significance but it is evident from the statements made by defendant No. 2 that he was simply offering his defence by blaming others.

18. The plaintiff has averred that the sting operation is a collaborative adventure between the defendant No.1 and defendant No. 2 in which both of them stood to gain in their own way, the defendant No.1 by creating a sensational story and defendant No. 2 availing a platform to provide and offer defence.

19. The plaintiff has averred in the plaint that he had been publicly appreciated by the members of the victim community in saving lives, particularly in the area of police station Nizamuddin and the felicitation function held was attended by the plaintiff along with other local police officers after seeking due permission from the departmental authorities. It is also averred by the plaintiff that individual members of the victim Page No. 9/107 community have appreciated his services in saving lives elsewhere in the South district. It is further averred by the plaintiff that the same is a matter of record in the various inquiry reports and in case it becomes necessary, the inquiry report will be proved during the trial of the suit.

20. The plaintiff has averred in the plaint that malice and lack of good faith on the part of defendant No.1 are evident from the fact that during the sting operation, the defendant No.1 took the version of other senior officers but wilfully avoided the plaintiff to take his version of facts, as the same would have demolished the defamatory statements made by his cohort, defendant No. 2. It is averred by the plaintiff that the defendant No. 1 omitted in narration to highlight the statement of the then station house officer of Mehrauli police station, namely, Jaipal Singh, who can be clearly seen and heard stating in the impugned sting video that the plaintiff was deliberately targeted by Mr. Marwah (Marwah Inquiry Committee of November 1984) for extraneous reasons.

21. The plaintiff has averred that the timing of publishing the sting operation in print by the defendant No. 1 as well as electronic media exposes the defendant No. 1 in his purpose and intent which is not to serve any public good but to make maximum money for himself as in the print media i.e. Times of India Article dated 22.04.2014, the statements of SHO level officers are shown recorded in the year 2011 but to lend the sting currency in time, the defendant No. 1 recorded the statements of Gautam Kaul and Subhash Tandon in 2014 at the time of Page No. 10/107 voting for General Elections 2014. It is averred by the plaintiff that the same shows that the defendant No. 1 wanted to bargain form the maximum price with the political parties at the opportune time.

22. The plaintiff has averred in the plaint not only by self-serving, false statements of the defendant No. 2 but also in defendant No. 1's scurrilous anchoring, he falsely projected with malicious intention and not in good faith to make his story sensational that Nanavati Commission had recommended penal action against the plaintiff but the plaintiff escaped action because of the fact of him having retired from the police services. The plaintiff has averred that on study of the Nanavati Commission Report it is disclosed no such recommendation for penal action was made. It is further averred that in fact there was no complaint affidavit against the plaintiff filed before the Nanavati Commission. It is averred by the plaintiff that the Nanavati Commission Report has reiterated the contents of Kusum Lata Mittal Report based on which a departmental inquiry was held against the plaintiff in the year 1988 and after recording of evidence no charge was proved against the plaintiff. The government unjustifiably and in violation of the rules disagreed with the findings of the Inquiry Report of the Commissioner of Inquiries. The plaintiff has averred that he battled against the decision of the government to not accept the departmental inquiry and challenged the same before the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi and an interim order dated 23.09.1998 was passed in favour of the plaintiff.

Page No. 11/107

23. The plaintiff has averred that the matter was sub judice before the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi when he was summoned by the Nanavati Commission. The plaintiff has further averred that for the final decision the matter went up to the Central Administrative Tribunal and it was observed by the Central Administrative Tribunal that the plaintiff has been made a scapegoat and accordingly set aside the adverse order passed by the government with regard to the plaintiff's pension.

24. The plaintiff has averred that all the facts and circumstances averred by him in the plaint revealed the malicious intention, lack of good faith on the part of the defendant Nos. 1 and 2, to scandalise the plaintiff by the so-called sting operation. It is averred by the plaintiff that the defendant No. 1 resorted to such dubious tactics to make his story sensational and more saleable with no concern that it is the plaintiff's reputation which would be a collateral damage. It is averred by the plaintiff that in media one can make a false statement and get away, whereas in judicial proceedings in a court of law making a false statement may land a person in jail. It is further averred by the plaintiff that a notice dated 15.05.2014 was sent by him to the defendant No. 1 to confirm whether any reply to his notice dated 28.04.2014 had been sent by him to the plaintiff. A similar notice was also dispatched to defendant No. 2.

25. With regard to defendant No. 3, the plaintiff has averred that the defendant number three was concerned by publishing the impugned news item, which caused intense damage to the reputation of the Page No. 12/107 plaintiff and even lowered his estimation amongst retired police officers, serving police officers, relatives, friends and known social circles. It is averred by the plaintiff that the defendant No. 3 did not act in good faith and abandoned due care and caution at the peril of plaintiff's reputation. It is further averred by the plaintiff that the defendant No. 3 did not adhere to the professional standards and ethics of journalism, as he did not specify himself about the truth of the statements made against the plaintiff. It is averred by the plaintiff that journalists do not enjoy special privilege in cases of defamation and are at par with ordinary citizens. It is averred by the plaintiff in the plaint that ostensible show off in the news item cannot vouch for the interviews and the same is a subterfuge to collude with the mala fide, evil designs of defendant Nos. 1 and 2.

26. The plaintiff has averred in the plaint that the defendants acted wrongfully, maliciously and dishonestly with reckless disregard for truth and resultant of which the defendants are joint tortfeasors and are jointly and severally liable for damages be it general, special, exemplary and punitive for causing pecuniary and nonpecuniary losses to the plaintiff. It is averred by the plaintiff that he has suffered huge and substantial damage, as he is widely known in the areas of his postings among the retired and serving officers and as a minimalistic estimate, the plaintiff claims â¹15,00,000/- (Rupees Fifteen lakhs only) as damages from the defendants.

27. The plaintiff has averred that the cause of action arose to prefer and maintain the present suit against the defendants arose on 22.04.2014, Page No. 13/107 when the impugned news article/report was published in the newspaper and thereafter subsequent cause of action arose on the dates when the plaintiff issued notice to the defendants. It is averred by the plaintiff that the cause of action arose in Dwarka, New Delhi where the newspaper in question is widely circulated and read. It is also averred by the plaintiff that the cause of action arose in New Delhi as serious injury and damage has been caused to his reputation. Hence, the suit for damages to the tune of â¹15,00,000/- (Rupees Fifteen lakhs only) on account of the plaintiff being defamed by the defendants.

28. The written statement preferred by Aniruddha Bahal (defendant No. 1) has taken the preliminary objection of the suit being barred for misjoinder of parties. The defendant No. 1 has also taken a preliminary objection of no cause of action having arisen in favour of the plaintiff to prefer a suit for damages against the defendant No. 1. The defendant No. 1 has also taken a preliminary objection that the plaint is bereft of any single averment with regard to in whose eyes and for whom the plaintiff has been defamed. The defendant No. 1 has taken a preliminary objection that the plaint preferred by the plaintiff is nothing but false and concocted facts to mislead the Court and to harass the defendant No. 1. The defendant No. 1 has also taken a preliminary objection on the maintainability of the suit for want of jurisdiction.

29. From the perusal of the reply on merits in the written statement, the defence urged by the defendant No. 1 is that of a shield of the justification of truth. It is urged by the defendant No. 1 that the news Page No. 14/107 article was based on information already available in the public domain and which also formed part of Mishra Commission, Kusum Lata Lata Mittal Report, Nanawati Commission Report.

30. The defendant No. 1 in its written statement has declined that he had colluded with the other defendants, particularly, defendant No. 2 and caused any loss and damage to the reputation of the plaintiff. The defendant No. 1 has declined all the allegations made by the plaintiff in his plaint that the sting operation was undertaken by the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 to make maximum money in the year of General Elections. The defendant No. 1 has averred in his defence that Cobrapost is a purely journalistic venture of forum for media and literature, a non-profit non- government organisation advocating free media by generating critical discussion on key social issues. It is also averred by defendant No. 1 in his defence that he absolutely has no commercial interest. In short, the defendant No. 1, has urged in his defence that he never sullied the reputation of the plaintiff and with the plaintiff not being defamed, no case for awarding damages is made out.

31. The written statement preferred by the defendant No. 2 is also on the similar lines of the defendant No. 1 that no disrepute has been caused to the plaintiff. It is urged by the defendant No. 2 that the plaintiff had unfairly and in a biased manner impleaded him on false grounds in an arbitrary and illegal manner in the year 1984. It is averred by the defendant No. 2 in his statement that the plaintiff is nursing an Page No. 15/107 old grudge against the defendant No. 2, which is apparent nay evident from the plaint.

32. The defendant No. 2 has also urged that the suit is not maintainable against him for want of cause of action. It is urged by the defendant No. 2 that he was neither involved in the alleged sting operation carried out by Cobrapost nor in the impugned news article published in the Times of India on 22.0.2014.

33. The defendant No. 2 has denied seeing the original compact disc (CD) of the alleged sting operation but he has averred in his defence that to his knowledge he never gave any interview and spoke to any personal of the Cobrapost alleging imputations against the plaintiff.

34. The defendant No. 2 has admitted in his defence that he was the station house officer of the police station Delhi Cantonment in the year 1984 and the plaintiff was the Deputy Commissioner of Police of South district. The defendant No. 2 has denied any dereliction of duty on his part. It is averred by the defendant No. 2 that the plaintiff was biased towards him on account of the defendant No. 2 being an upright officer for which the plaintiff suspended him temporarily. It is averred by the defendant No. 2 that the plaintiff did not disclose in his plaint that the defendant No. 2 was reinstated with all the benefits and even promoted to the rank of Asstt. Commissioner of Police. The defendant No. 2 has averred in the written statement that the plaintiff has concealed the fact from this Court that the defendant No. 2 was given a clean chit by the Ranganath Misra Commissioner. It is further averred by the defendant Page No. 16/107 No. 2 that the plaintiff had been hellbent to ruin his reputation. In short, the defendant No. 2 has denied having defamed the plaintiff in any manner. The defendant No. 2 has urged that the suit preferred by the plaintiff against him be dismissed as no case of defamation is made out.

35. The written statement preferred on behalf of the defendant No. 3 assails the maintainability of the suit for being a total abuse of process of law.

36. The defendant No. 3 has stated in his defence that the news article published relied upon a sting and the defendant repeatedly emphasised the fact that the sting revealed are only allegations and defendant did not in any way endorse them. It is urged by the defendant No. 3 that he was careful in ensuring that nowhere did it appear that it was either vouching for the authenticity of the sting and the allegations made by those stung, even if the tapes were authentic. The defendant No. 3 has averred in his written statement that he was careful to an extent that he even made it clear in the article that Rohtas Singh (defendant No. 2 herein), the man making the allegations against the plaintiff was himself indicted by an inquiry commission.

37. The defendant No. 3 has urged in his defence that the news article/report was published based on the premise, for the information of his readers in public interest without any illegal or malice against the plaintiff. It is averred by the defendant No. 3 that it is within common knowledge that innocent people of particular community lost their lives and with passage of time there are people, who are still fighting in Page No. 17/107 Courts to get justice. It is urged by the defendant No. 3 that the sting was on matter of public interest and the same was published for the information of the readers as the readers have a right to know, which is a part of freedom of speech of expression indeed a valuable right granted by the Constitution of the country. The defendant No. 3 has averred that the article was published only with the intention to inform its readers about the sting and what has come out in the sting without giving his views or vouching for the authenticity of the sting of statements of the stung.

38. The defendant No. 3 has denied all the allegations made by the plaintiff and taken a stance that no case for defamation is made out in favour of the plaintiff and the question of awarding damages to the tune of â¹15,00,000/- (Rupees Fifteen lakhs only) does not arise.

39. To the written statements filed by the defendants, the plaintiff did file respective replications.

"Appeal from the judgment and order dated February 25, 1965 of the Patna High Court in First Appeals Nos. 437 and 438 of 1959.

S. V. Gupte, B. P. Rajgarhia and U. P. Singh, for the appellants in C.A. Nos. 661 and 1380 of 1967) and for respondent No. 1 C.A. Nos. 1885 and 1886 of 1967). D. Goburdhun, for the respondent (in C.A. Nos. 661 and 1380 if 1967 and for the appellant (in C.A. Nos. 1885 and 1886 of 1967).

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by P. laganmohan Reddy, J. These appeals are by certificate against the judgment of the Patna High Court in land acquisition appeals. Two notifications dated 7-7-1954 under section 4 of the. Land Acquisition Act 1894 (Act 1 of 1894) (hereinafter called 'the Act'), were issued one in respect of a portion of Plot Nos. 178 and 1784 admeasuring 2.65 acres and the other in respect of the whole of the plot No. 1783 admeasuring 2 acres situated in Ward No. 3 of Ranchi Municipality. Section 6 notification in respect of these lands was published on 7-9-1954 and possession was taken on 23-9-1954 under section 17(1) after making a declaration under section 17(4) that the provisions of section 5A shall not apply. The Collector awarded compensation of Rs. 1,20,419-6-11 in respect of the first acquisition and Rs. 47,648-13-6 in respect of the second. Thereafter, at the instance of the claimant, a reference under section 18 of the Act was made to the Judicial Commissioner of Chhota Nagpur, Ranchi who. while maintaining the market value, of the land, awarded by the Collector, gave further compensation for severance at the rate of 5% and 10% in respect of potential value of the land. The Judicial Commissioner, however, did not grant the 15% solatium under section 23(2) of the Act. Being dissatisfied, the claimants preferred appeals to the High Court. The High Court revised the compensation and awarded Rs. 90,000/-per acre and 15% as solatium on the market value under section 23(2) of the Act but did not grant them the 5% towards severance. Interest at 6% per annum on the amount of enhanced compensation from 23-9-1954 together with costs was also decreed. Against the judgment and decree, the claimants have filed Civil Appeals 661 & 1380/67 while the State has filed Civil Appeals 1885- 86/67.

The lands in question which have been acquired were earlier leased on 22-9-1944 to the Military authorities on a rent of Rs. 600/- per month for a period of 6 months under a registered deed with option Lo renew for a maximum period of 10 years 2lO which period expired on 21-9-1954. One of the conditions of the lease was that on the termination of the lease, the lessor would exercise the option given under the lease to purchase all buildings, structures, gardens and any other structures constructed by the lessee during their occupation of the leased property, at 75 per cent of the valuation that would be determined by the Superintending Engineer, Chhota Nagpur Circle, and in case the lessors refused to purchase, the lessee was entitled to dismantle and take away the materials. Towards the end of the lease period, the Govern- ment of Bihar decided to acquire the property for the State Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen's Board and initiated proceedings as aforesaid.

In these appeals the only question that has to be determined is : What is the market value of the property as on the date of section 4 notification ? In the valuation report given by the Land Acquisition Officer, Ranchi, Ex-1, the principle of capitalisation on the basis of 20 times the annual rental of Rs. 7,200/- at the rate of Rs. 600/- p.m. was adopted as the price of-the lands. In that report it was also pointed out that the sale price of 1.08.5 acres out of the premises of the Ranchi Club as per registered sale-deed, Ex. C-1 dated 1-4-1953, was Rs. 41,470/- per acre. which was not fair. Apart from these 25 other sale transactions in respect of portions of Plot No. 1789 between 1952 and 1953 were also referred in that report. Some of these lands were situated opposite to the Ranchi Club and the sale price came to Rs. 1092/- per katha, which is about Rs. 60,000/- per acre. He was further pointed out that some other lands a little further away from the main road but belonging to the same Plot No. 1789 were sold at the rates between Rs. 250 / /- to Rs. 800/- per katha. This report formed the basis of the award made by the Collector. The High Court took judicial notice, and in our view rightly so, that after the termination of the Second World War in 1945 there was a rise in land values due to the increased demand of homestead lands for building purposes. It also considered various sale-deeds produced and proved on behalf of the claimants along with the oral evidence to determine the market value of the land. The objections from both the appellant and the respondent were taken into account in respect of each of these and most of them were considered as not furnishing a proper or adequate valuation either having regard to the distance of the lands which were the subject-matter of the sale or the inadequacy of the information pertaining thereto. The High Court, however, adopted the price in the sale deed Ex-C-1 executed on 6-5-1953 by the Ranchi Club Ltd., in favour of the President of India in respect of 1.085 acres 3 bighas 5 kathas 10 chhataks in Plot No. 1221 for Rs. 45,000/:as the basis for arriving at the market value of the acquired land.

Though the land in question was situated on the main Ranchi- Chaibasa Road, a strong objection was taken against adopting the price as a basis because it was not only 1/2 mile away from the land under acquisition but what was sold was only the leasehold right in the land. These objections were rejected on the ground that for all,practical purposes the interest that was held or sold by the Ranchi Club under Ex.C-1 was not inferior to an absolute title. The area of the land, the subject matter of the sale, was considered to be fairly large being more than 1 acre and the situation was also the same as the land under acquisition except that it was farther away from it. In these circumstances, the High Court thought, after a proper allowance is made for the difference in distance, the transaction yields a more acceptable guide for determining the market value of the land under acquisition and accordingly, it adopted twice the price. as charged for the land in Ext.C-1 as indicating a fair market value of the land in question. The High Court further added Rs. 7060/- per acre as the difference between tenure rights and lease-hold rights that were held by the President of India and awarded Rs. 90,00O./- per acre. This. it did notwithstanding the fact that it was conscious that there was no definite data for the two additions that have been made, because in its view, in cases of this nature a certain amount of estimate has to be made which may even be arbitrary. Accordingly, it awarded compensation for the 4.65 acres of land which was acquired by the Government at Rs. 90,000/ per acre together with 15% solatium Payable under clause (2) of section 23 of the Act. 5% compensation for severance of land from the claimants' other portion of the land that remained with them after acquisition, which was awarded by the Judicial Commissioner, Chhota Nagpur, was disallowed on the ground that there was an entrance to the back portion of the land which was left with the #owners and also because there was no evidence to show that in fact there had been any depreciation in he value of the remaining area and if so, to what extent. On the other hand, it main- tained the 10% on the market value of the land awarded by the Land Acquisition Court on account of the increase in the potentialities of the land. The basis adopted by the High Court is challenged on the ground that they are contrary to the well established principles applicable for determining the value of lands acquired under the Act.

The general principles for determining compensation have, been set out in sections 23 & 24 of the Act. The compensation payable to the owner of the land is the market value which is determined by reference to the price which a seller might reasonably expect to obtain from a willing purchaser, bat as this may not be possible to ascertain with any amount of precision, the authority charged with the duty to award compensation is bound to make an estimate judged by an objective standard. The land acqui red has, therefore, to be valued not only with reference to its condition at the time of the declaration under section 4 of the Act but its potential value also must be taken into account. The sale-deeds of the lands situated in the vicinity and the comparable benefits and advantages which they have, furnish a rough and ready method of computing the market value. This, however, is not the only method. The rent which an owner was actually receiving at the relevant point of time or the rent which the neighbouring lands of similar nature are fetching can be taken into account by capitalising the rent which according to the present prevailing rate of interest is 20 times the annual rent. But this also is not a conclusive method.This Court had in Special Land Acquisition Officer, Bangalore v. T. Adinarayan Setty(1), indicated at page 412 the methods of valuation to be adopted in ascertaining the market value of the land on the date of the notificatioa under section 4(1) which are : (i) opinion of experts, (ii) the price paid within a reasonable time in bona fide transactions of purchase ,of the lands acquired or the lands adjacent to the lands acquired and possessing similar advantages; and (iii) a number of years' purchase of the actual or immediately prospective profits of the lands acquired. These methods, however, do not preclude the Court from taking any other special circumstances into consideration, the requirement being always to arrive as near as possible an estimate of the market value. In arriving to a reasonably correct market value, it may be necessary to take even two or all of those methods into account inasmuch as the exact valuation is not always possible as no two lands may be the same either in respect of the situation or the extent or the potentially nor is it possible in all cases to have reliable material from which that valuation can be accurately determined.

Bearing these principles in mind, we do not think that the High Court was justified in adopting the registered sale- deed, Ex.C-1 executed by the Ranchi Club, in favour of the President of India, because that land is farther away not only from the, land acquired but from the town though it is on the main RanchiChaibasa Road. Even the High Court recognised that there was no definite data for the two additions that have been made and in our view it would not be a proper method of ascertaining the value of the land 'acquired. The only two documents that may be considered are Ex.10 and Ex-11 which are in respect of the lands situated in the vicinity and on either side of the land ac- quired. The other sale deeds are of smaller areas and do not furnish a proper basis for ascertaining the market value and have been- quite properly not relied upon by the learned Advocate for (1) (1959) (Supp1. 1) S.CR. 404.

the claimants' The annual rental value of the land acquired, namely, Rs. 7 200/- will also not furnish a proper method of computation because that was a rent fixed in 1944 when that land was not of such great value as it had acquired at the time when sec. 4 notification was issued. A perusal of the correspondence between the owners of the land and the Deputy Commissioner of Ranchi would show that the land owners had given it at consessional rate to' the Military authorities having regard to the purpose for which it was being put to use. On behalf of the claimants great reliance is placed on Ex.11 which is a sale-deed executed on 16-12- 1946 by the claimants the Ranchi Automobiles of an area of 1 bigha 17 kathas equal to .617 acres for Rs. 1,45,000/. After deducting Rs. 15,403/- the price of the structures according ;to the Engineer's report in 1959 (Ex-25), the net value of the land is Rs. 1,29,697/-. This value would work out to Rs. 2,08,135.70 per acre. The High Court rejected this computation on the ground that though the land was contiguous to the land under acquisition, neither the value of the pump and the other structures belonging to Burmah Shell nor the value of the structures that might have been on the land on the date of the sale which were built by the vendees as lessees could be ascertained either from the sale-deed or the evidence. Ex.10 is a lease in respect of 1/3 acre granted by the owners to Thakur Chandra Bali Shah and others executed on 20-2-1950 on a monthly rent of Rs. 157/-. The High Court calculated the monthly rental of the land under acquisition at that rate to be not less than Rs. 2,000/- per month or Rs. 24,000/- per year. On the basis of 20 times the annual rent if computed Rs. 4,80,000/as the market value which works out at Rs. 1,03,226/per acre. It is, however, pointed out on behalf of the claimants that the High Court made a mistake in thinking that the rent for the land leased under Ex.10 was Rs. 157/- p.m. and on that basis it calculated the annual rental value of 4.65 acres of the' acquired land. We have checked the figures from the original lease and find that in fact the rent is Rs. 175/- and not Rs. 157/-. On this basis the rate per acre of 20 times annual rental value would come to Rs. 1,26,000/-. Even if Ex. 11 is to be taken as, the basis and ,the value of the structures as given by the Engineer in Ex.25 is to be accepted that cannot furnish a proper basis because the land in question is a small area of .617 acres or just over 1 an acre. A smaller area such as this on a main road Would certainly fetch a higher price compared to a larger un- developed area even though it may have a frontage on the main road. In order to develop that area atleast the value of 1/3 of the land will have to be deducted for roads, drainage and other amenities. On this basis, the value of the land at Rs. 2,08,135.70 per acre would, after deduction of 1/3 come to Rs. 1,38,757/per acre. On the basis of the rental of Rs. 175/- p.m. in Ex.10, the value at 20 times the rental will work out as already seen at Rs. 1,26,000/-. Allowing for an increase in rents from 1950 to 1954, the date of section 4 notification, say at 5% the value per acre may be Rs. 1,33,000/- or thereabout. If we take the average of Ex.10 and Ex.11 as computed by us the value per acre would come to about Rs. 1,35,878/-. In our view, Rs. 1,35,000/- per acre would be a reasonable rate at which compensation could be awarded to the claimants. The High Court was not justified in giving 10% towards potential value because that element is inherent in the fixation of the market value of the land and could not be assessed separately. The High Court was also not justified in disallowing 5% awarded by the Judicial Commissioner, Chhotanagpur as compensation for severance merely because there was an entrance to the land. When a portion left out there would be a diminution in the value of ;the land that is left out for which some compensation has to be allowed. The 5% allowed by the Judicial Commissioner, Chhotanagpur is reasonable. In this view, the claimants would be entitled to a decree as follows in respect of the lands acquired :-

(1) At the rate of Rs. 1,35,000 per acre for 4.65 acres;
(2) 5% severence and 15% solatium on the market value computed as in (1); (3) Interest at 6% from the-date of taking possession.
The appeals of the claimants are allowed to the extent of the variation and those by the Government are dismissed with costs. The claimants will be entitled to proportionate costs on the difference between the amounts decreed and those that are now awarded in each of the two appeals filed by them.
