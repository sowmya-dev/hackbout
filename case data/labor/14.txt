   JUDGMENT
The appellants are the claimants in O.P.(MV)No.777 of 2014 on the file of the Additional Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Mavelikkara, a claim petition filed under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, claiming compensation on account of the death of one Raveendran Nair, husband of the 1st appellant and father of appellants 2 and 3, in a motor accident which occurred on 26.01.2014, while he was walking along the side of a public road. At the place of accident, he was knocked down by a scooter bearing registration No.KL-30/C-5464, ridden by the 1 st respondent before the Tribunal, owned by the 1 st respondent herein and insured with the 2nd respondent herein. In the accident, he sustained fatal injuries, who succumbed to the injuries on 18.02.2014, while undergoing in-patient treatment. Alleging that the accident occurred due to rash and negligent riding of scooter by its rider, claim petition was filed before the Tribunal, claiming a total compensation of Rs.11,73,000/- under MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) various heads, which was limited to Rs.11,50,000/-, for the purpose of payment of Court Fee.

2. Before the Tribunal, the 1st respondent herein filed written statement admitting the accident; however, denying negligence alleged against the 1st respondent. According to him, the accident occurred due to the negligence on the part of the deceased in crossing the road. The insurer filed written statement admitting the policy coverage of the scooter involved in the accident; however, denying negligence alleged against the rider of that vehicle. The insurer contended that the accident occurred due to the negligence on the part of the deceased. The rider of the scooter was not holding a valid driving licence as on the date of accident, and therefore, there is violation of conditions of policy. The insurer disputed the age, occupation, monthly income, etc. stated in the claim petition and contended that the compensation claimed is highly excessive.

3. Before the Tribunal, Exts.A1 to A13 were marked on the side of the appellants/claimants. Exts.B1 was marked on the side of the respondents. Both sides have not chosen to adduce any oral evidence.

MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C)
4. After considering the pleadings and materials on record, the Tribunal arrived at a conclusion that the accident occurred due to the rash and negligent riding of the scooter by its rider. Since insurance coverage of the said vehicle was not in dispute, the insurer was held liable to indemnify the insured. However, on a finding that, as on the date of accident, the rider of the scooter was not holding a valid driving licence, the insurer was granted recovery right to proceed against the owner, for recovering the amount of compensation paid to the claimants. Under various heads, the Tribunal awarded a total compensation of Rs.6,11,472/- together with interest at the rate 7.5% per annum from the date of petition, i.e., from 25.06.2014, till the date of realisation, with proportionate cost and the insurer was directed to satisfy the award, subject to recovery right.

5. Dissatisfied with the quantum of compensation awarded by the Tribunal under various heads, the appellants/ claimants are before this Court in this appeal.

6. Heard the learned counsel for the appellants/ claimants, the learned counsel for the 1 st respondent owner and also the learned Senior Standing Counsel for the 2 nd respondent MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) insurer.

7. The issue that arises for consideration in this appeal is as to whether the appellants/claimants are entitled for enhancement of the compensation awarded by the Tribunal under various heads. During the course of arguments, learned counsel for the appellants would submit that the challenge made in this appeal can be confined to inadequacy of compensation awarded by the Tribunal under the heads transportation to hospital; extra nourishment; bystanders expense; damage to clothing; dependency compensation; and loss of love and affection to appellants 2 and 3.

8. In Sarla Verma v. Delhi Transport Corporation [(2009) 6 SCC 121] the Apex Court laid down the principles governing determination of quantum of compensation in the case of death in a motor accident. The Apex Court held that, the compensation awarded does not become 'just compensation' merely because the Tribunal considers it to be just. Just compensation is adequate compensation which is fair and equitable, on the facts and circumstances of the case, to make good the loss suffered as a result of the wrong, as far as money MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) can do so, by applying the well settled principles relating to award of compensation. It is not intended to be a bonanza, largesse or source of profit. To have uniformity and consistency, Tribunals should determine compensation in cases of death, by following the well settled steps, namely, ascertaining the multiplicand (annual contribution to the family), the multiplier and calculation of loss of dependency by multiplying the multiplicand by such multiplier.

9. In National Insurance Company Ltd. v. Pranay Sethi [(2017) 16 SCC 680], a Constitution Bench of the Apex Court held that, Section 168 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 deals with the concept of 'just compensation' and the same has to be determined on the foundation of fairness, reasonableness and equitability on acceptable legal standard because such determination can never be in arithmetical exactitude. It can never be perfect. The aim is to achieve an acceptable degree of proximity to arithmetical precision on the basis of materials brought on record in an individual case. The conception of 'just compensation' has to be viewed through the prism of fairness, reasonableness and non-violation of the principle of equitability. In a case of death, the legal heirs of the claimants cannot expect a MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) windfall. Simultaneously, the compensation granted cannot be an apology for compensation. It cannot be a pittance. Though the discretion vested in the Tribunal is quite wide, yet it is obligatory on the part of the Tribunal to be guided by the expression, i.e., just compensation.

10. In the instant case, the compensation awarded by the Tribunal under various heads reads thus;

                                    Rs.11,50,0000)
         11.   The accident occurred on 26.01.2014.                At the time of
 MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C)




accident, the deceased was aged 59 years. It was claimed that, at the time of accident, the deceased was earning a monthly income of Rs.12,000/- as Lab Technician. The document marked as Ext.A12 is the salary certificate, in which the salary of the deceased was shown as Rs.7,000/-. The appellants have not taken steps to prove Ext.A12. The Tribunal fixed the monthly income of the deceased notionally as Rs.5,500/-.

12. In Ramachandrappa v. Manager, Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Company Limited [(2011) 13 SCC 236] the Apex Court reckoned the monthly income of a coolie (manual labourer), who met with a road accident in the year 2004, at the age of 35 years, notionally as Rs.4,500/-. The Apex Court held that, the claimant who was working as a coolie cannot be expected to produce any documentary evidence to substantiate his claim. In the absence of any other evidence contrary to the claim made by the claimant, in the facts of the said case, the Tribunal should have accepted the claim of the claimant. The Apex Court made it clear that, in all cases and in all circumstances, the Tribunal need not accept the claim of the claimant, in the absence of supporting material. It depends on the facts of each case. In a MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) given case, if the claim made is so exorbitant or if the claim made is contrary to ground realities, the Tribunal may not accept the claim and may proceed to determine the possible income by resorting to some guess work, which may include the ground realities prevailing at the relevant point of time.

13. In Syed Sadiq v. Divisional Manager, United India Insurance Co. Ltd. [(2014) 2 SCC 735], taking note of the earlier decision in Ramachandrappa's case (supra), the Apex Court reckoned the monthly income of a vegetable vendor, who met with a road accident in the year 2008, at the age of 24 years, notionally as Rs.6,500/-. In the said decision, the Apex Court held that, a labourer in an unorganised sector doing his own business cannot be expected to produce documents to prove his monthly income. Therefore, there was no reason for the Tribunal and the High Court to ask for evidence to prove his monthly income. Going by the state of economy prevailing at that time and the rising prices in agricultural products, the Apex Court accepted his case that a vegetable vendor is reasonably capable of earning 6,500/- per month.

14. In the absence of any reliable evidence, considering the MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) economic conditions prevailing at the time of accident, i.e., during the year 2014, and taking note of the fixation of notional monthly income by the Apex Court in the decisions referred to supra, the monthly income of the deceased shown in Ext.A12 salary certificate as Rs.7,000/-, cannot be said to be on the higher side, which is taken as his notional monthly income, for the purpose of assessing compensation under various heads.

15. In Pranay Sethi [(2017) 16 SCC 680], a Constitution Bench of the Apex Court held that, the determination of 'just compensation' has to be on the foundation of evidence brought on record as regards the age and income of the deceased and thereafter the apposite multiplier to be applied. The formula relating to multiplier has been clearly stated in Sarla Verma [(2009) 6 SCC 121] and it has been approved in Reshma Kumari v. Madan Mohan [(2013) 9 SCC 65]. The age and income, as stated earlier, have to be established by adducing evidence. The Tribunal and the Courts have to bear in mind that the basic principle lies in pragmatic computation which is in proximity to reality. It is a well accepted norm that money cannot substitute a life lost but an effort has to be made for grant of just MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) compensation having uniformity of approach. There has to be a balance between the two extremes, that is, a windfall and the pittance, a bonanza and the modicum. In such an adjudication, the duty of the Tribunal and the Courts is difficult and hence, an endeavour has been made by this Court for standardization which in its ambit includes addition of future prospects on the proven income at present. As far as future prospects are concerned, there has been standardization keeping in view the principle of certainty, stability and consistency. In Pranay Sethi the Apex Court approved the principle of 'standardisation' so that a specific and certain multiplicand is determined for applying the multiplier on the basis of age.

16. In Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh [(2013) 9 SCC 54], a Three-Judge Bench of the Apex Court held that, in case of self- employed persons also, if the deceased victim is below 40 years, there must be addition of 50% to the actual income of the deceased while computing future prospects. In Munna Lal Jain v. Vipin Kumar Sharma [(2015) 6 SCC 347] another Three-Judge Bench followed the principle stated in Rajesh. In Pranay Sethi, after expressing the opinion that the dicta laid down in Reshma MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) Kumari being earlier in point of time would be a binding precedent and not the decision in Rajesh, the Constitution Bench observed that, in Munna Lal Jain, the Three-Judge Bench should have been guided by the principle stated in Reshma Kumari which has concurred with the view expressed in Sarla Devi or in case of disagreement, it should have been well advised to refer the case to a Larger Bench.

17. In Pranay Sethi [(2017) 16 SCC 680] the Constitution Bench held that, while determining the income, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the income of the deceased towards future prospects, where the deceased had a permanent job and was below the age of 40 years, should be made. The addition should be 30%, if the age of the deceased was between 40 to 50 years. In case the deceased was between the age of 50 to 60 years, the addition should be 15%. Actual salary should be read as actual salary less tax. The Apex Court held further that, in case the deceased was self-employed or on a fixed salary, an addition of 40% of the established income should be the warrant where the deceased was below the age of 40 years. An addition of 25% where the deceased was between the age of 40 to 50 MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) years and 10% where the deceased was between the age of 50 to 60 years should be regarded as the necessary method of computation. The established income means the income minus the tax component.

18. In the instant case, at the time of accident, the deceased was aged 59 years. It was claimed that, at the time of accident, the deceased was earning monthly income as Lab Technician. The Tribunal fixed the monthly income of the deceased notionally as Rs.5,500/-. In the impugned award, relying on the decision of the Apex Court in Pranay Sethi, the Tribunal rightly added 10% of the notional monthly income of the deceased towards future prospects.

19. As already noticed, no reliable materials were placed before the Tribunal to show that, at the time of accident, the deceased had a permanent job. Therefore, the deceased can only be treated as on a fixed salary. In view of the law laid down by the Apex Court in Pranay Sethi, an addition of 10% of the notional monthly income of the deceased, as re-fixed in this appeal considering the economic conditions prevailing at the time of accident and taking note of the fixation of notional monthly MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) income by the Apex Court in Ramachandrappa and in Syed Sadiq referred to supra, can be made towards future prospects, since the deceased was aged between the age of 50 to 60 years.

20. Therefore, for the purpose of re-fixing the compensation under the head loss of dependency, 10% of the monthly income of the deceased notionally re-fixed in this appeal as Rs.7,000/-, i.e., a sum of Rs.700/- (7,000 x 10/100) has to be added towards future prospects. In the result, the monthly income of the deceased, for the purpose of re-fixing the compensation under the head loss of dependency, is reckoned as Rs.7,700/- (7,000 +700).

21. In Sarla Verma [(2009) 6 SCC 121], the Apex Court, after referring to its earlier decisions in Kerala State Road Transport Corporation v. Susamma Thomas [(1994) 2 SCC 176], U.P. State Road Transport Corporation v. Trilok Chandra [(1996) 4 SCC 362] and New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Charlie [(2005) 10 SCC 720] held that the multiplier to be used should be as mentioned in column (4) of the Table in paragraph 40 of the said decision [prepared by applying MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) Susamma Thomas, Trilok Chandra and Charlie], which starts with an operative multiplier of 18 [for the age groups of 15 to 20 and 21 to 25 years], reduced by one unit for every five years, i.e., multiplier of 17 for 26 to 30 years, multiplier of 16 for 31 to 35 years, multiplier of 15 for 36 to 40 years, multiplier of 14 for 41 to 45 years, and multiplier of 13 for 46 to 50 years, then reduced by two units for every five years, i.e., multiplier of 11 for 51 to 55 years, multiplier of 9 for 56 to 60 years, multiplier of 7 for 61 to 65 years and multiplier of 5 for 66 to 70 years.

22. In Pranay Sethi [(2017) 16 SCC 680] the Constitution Bench of the Apex Court held that, as far as the multiplier is concerned, the Claims Tribunal and the Courts shall be guided by Step 2 that finds a place in paragraph 19 of Sarla Verma, read with paragraph 42 of the said judgment.

23. In the instant case, as on the date of accident, the deceased was aged 59 years. In the light of the decisions of the Apex Court in Sarla Verma's case and Pranay Sethi's case referred to supra, the multiplier of 9 applied by the Tribunal is correct and proper.

24. In Sarla Verma v. Delhi Transport Corporation MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) [(2009) 6 SCC 121] the Apex Court, on the question of deduction towards the personal and living expenses of the deceased held that, the personal and living expenses of the deceased should be deducted from his monthly income, to arrive at the contribution to the dependents. Where the deceased was married, the deduction towards personal and living expenses of the deceased should be one-third where the number of dependent family members is 2 to 3; one-fourth where the number of dependent family members is 4 to 6; and one-fifth where the number of dependent family members exceeds 6. In regard to bachelors, normally, 50% is deducted as personal and living expenses, because it is assumed that a bachelor would tend to spend more on himself. Even otherwise, there is also the possibility of his getting married in a short time, in which event the contribution to the parent(s) and siblings is likely to be cut drastically. Further, subject to evidence to the contrary, the father is likely to have his own income and will not be considered as a dependant and the mother alone will be considered as a dependent. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, brothers and sisters will not be considered as dependants, because they MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) will either be independent and earning, or married, or be dependent on the father. Thus even if the deceased is survived by parents and siblings, only the mother would be considered to be a dependant, and 50% would be treated as the personal and living expenses of the bachelor and 50% as the contribution to the family. However, where family of the bachelor is large and dependent on the income of the deceased, as in a case where he has a widowed mother and large number of younger non- earning sisters or brothers, his personal and living expenses may be restricted to one-third and contribution to the family will be taken as two-third.

25. In Reshma Kumari [(2013) 9 SCC 65] a Three-

Judge Bench of the Apex Court reproduced paragraphs 30, 31 and 32 of Sarla Verma and approved the same, in paragraph 38 of the decision, by stating that, the standards fixed in Sarla Verma provide guidance for the appropriate deduction for personal and living expenses. One must bear in mind that the proportion of a man's net earnings that he saves or spends exclusively for the maintenance of others does not form part of his living expenses but what he spends exclusively on himself does. The percentage MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) of deduction on account of personal and living expenses may vary with reference to the number of dependent members in the family and the personal living expenses of the deceased need not exactly correspond to the number of dependants. Therefore, the standards fixed in Sarla Verma on the aspect of deduction for personal living expenses in paras 30, 31 and 32 must ordinarily be followed unless a case for departure in the circumstances noted in the preceding paragraph is made out. In paragraph 43.6 the Apex Court directed that, insofar as deduction for personal and living expenses is concerned, the Tribunals shall ordinarily follow the standards prescribed in paragraphs 30, 31 and 32 of the judgment in Sarla Verma, subject to the observations made in para 38 of Reshma Kumari.

26. In Pranay Sethi [(2017) 16 SCC 680], the Constitution Bench of the Apex Court, after considering the analysis made in Sarla Verma, which was reconsidered in Reshma Kumari, approved the method provided therein by stating that, as far as the guidance provided for appropriate deduction for personal and living expenses is concerned, the Tribunals and Courts should be guided by the conclusion in MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) paragraph 43.6 of Reshma Kumari.

27. In the instant case, at the time of accident, the deceased was aged 59 years with a family consisting of 3 dependants. In the light of the decisions of the Apex Court in Sarla Verma, Reshma Kumari and Pranay Sethi referred to supra, deduction of 1/3rd of the notional monthly income of the deceased towards his personal and living expenses is perfectly legal.

28. Towards loss of dependency, the Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs.4,35,672/- (4,034 x 12 x 9). In this appeal, the monthly income of the deceased has already been re-fixed as Rs.7,000/-. Adding 10% of the notional monthly income of the deceased towards future prospects (7,000 + 700 = 7,700); deducting 1/3rd towards the personal and living expenses of the deceased; and applying the multiplier of 9, the compensation under the head loss of dependency is re-fixed as Rs.5,54,400/- (7,700 x 12 x 9 x 2/3), resulting an additional compensation of Rs.1,18,728/- (5,54,400 - 4,35,672).

29. In the impugned award, towards funeral expenses, the Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs.25,000/-. Towards loss of MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) consortium, the 1st appellant is awarded a sum of Rs.40,000/-. Towards loss of love and affection appellants 2 and 3 are awarded a sum of Rs.75,000/- The Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs.15,000/- under the head loss of estate.

30. In Rajesh [(2013) 9 SCC 54] a Three-Judge Bench of the Apex Court granted Rs.25,000/- towards funeral expenses, Rs.1,00,000/- towards loss of consortium and Rs.1,00,000/- towards loss of care and guidance for minor children.

31. In Pranay Sethi [(2017) 16 SCC 680] the Constitution Bench of the Apex Court held that the head relating to loss of care and guidance for minor children does not exist. Though Rajesh refers to Santosh Devi v. National Insurance Company Limited [(2012) 6 SCC 421], it does not seem to follow the same. The conventional and traditional heads cannot be determined on percentage basis because that would not be an acceptable criterion. Unlike determination of income, the said heads have to be quantified. Any quantification must have a reasonable foundation. There can be no dispute over the fact that price index, fall in bank interest, escalation of rates in many a field have to be noticed. The Court cannot remain oblivious to the MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) same. There has been a thumb rule in this aspect. Otherwise, there will be extreme difficulty in determination of the same and unless the thumb rule is applied, there will be immense variation lacking any kind of consistency as a consequence of which, the orders passed by the Tribunals and Courts are likely to be unguided. Therefore, the reasonable figures on conventional heads, namely, loss of estate, loss of consortium and funeral expenses should be Rs.15,000/-, Rs.40,000/- and Rs.15,000/- respectively. The principle of revisiting the said heads is an acceptable principle. But the revisit should not be fact- centric or quantum-centric. The Apex Court observed that, it would be condign that the amounts that have quantified as above should be enhanced on percentage basis in every three years and the enhancement should be at the rate of 10% in a span of three years, which will bring in consistency in respect of those heads.

32. In Santosh Devi v. Mahaveer Singh [(2018) 9 SCC 146] a Three-Judge Bench of the Apex Court granted compensation on conventional heads, in terms of the figures standardised by the Constitution Bench in the year 2017, in MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) Pranay Sethi, to the wife and children of one Puran Chand, who died in a motor accident, which occurred on 30.12.1992.

33. In Sureshchandra Bagmal Doshi v. New India Assurance Company Limited [(2018) 15 SCC 649] the Apex Court granted the figures on conventional heads standardised by the Constitution Bench in the year 2017, in Pranay Sethi, i.e., Rs.15,000/- as loss of estate; Rs.40,000/- towards loss of consortium; and Rs.15,000/- as funeral expenses to the parents [appellants before the Apex Court], who lost their only daughter in a motor accident which occurred on 16.08.1998. In the said decision, Rs.40,000/- granted in Pranay Sethi towards loss of consortium was granted to the appellants, who are the parents of the deceased, towards loss of love and affection. Paragraphs 1 and 14 of the said decision read thus;

"1. Fate can be cruel. This is a tragic case where the only daughter of a lawyer husband and a doctor wife, who got married early and unfortunately became a widow also at a young age, died in a vehicular accident, which took place on 16.8.1998. The claim of the parents (appellants herein) in respect of this unfortunate demise forms the subject matter of the present appeal.
xxx xxx xxx
14. Now coming to the last aspect, i.e., the conventional MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) heads, in National Insurance Company Ltd. v. Pranay Sethi [(2017) 16 SCC 680], it has been standardised at Rs.15,000 for loss of estate; Rs.40,000 towards loss of consortium (in the present case loss of love and affection) and Rs.15,000 towards funeral expenses. The total amount, thus, would be Rs.70,000, which as per the said judgment is capable of being enhanced @ 10 percent in the span of every three years. However, we are still within the window of three years." "underline supplied"
34. In Magma General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Nanu Ram @ Chuhru Ram [(2018) 18 SCC 130], after referring to the decision in Pranay Sethi, the Apex Court held that in legal parlance, 'consortium' is a compendious term which encompasses 'spousal consortium', 'parental consortium' and 'filial consortium'. The right to consortium would include the company, care, help, comfort, guidance, solace and affection of the deceased, which is a loss to his family. With respect to a spouse, it would include sexual relations with the deceased spouse. Spousal consortium is generally defined as rights pertaining to the relationship of a husband-wife which allows compensation to the surviving spouse for loss of 'company, society, co-operation, affection, and aid of the other in every conjugal relation'. Parental consortium is granted to the child upon the premature death of a parent, for MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) loss of 'parental aid, protection, affection, society, discipline, guidance and training'. Filial consortium is the right of the parents to compensation in the case of an accidental death of a child. An accident leading to the death of a child causes great shock and agony to the parents and family of the deceased. The greatest agony for a parent is to lose their child during their lifetime. Children are valued for their love, affection, companionship and their role in the family unit.

35. In Magma General Insurance the Apex Court held that consortium is a special prism reflecting changing norms about the status and worth of actual relationships. Modern jurisdictions world-over have recognised that the value of a child's consortium far exceeds the economic value of the compensation awarded in the case of the death of a child. Most jurisdictions, therefore, permit parents to be awarded compensation under loss of consortium on the death of a child. The amount awarded to the parents is a compensation for loss of the love, affection, care and companionship of the deceased child. The Motor Vehicles Act is a beneficial legislation aimed at providing relief to the victims or their families, in cases of genuine claims. In a case where parents MACA.No.3690 OF 2018(C) have lost their minor child, or unmarried son or daughter, the parents are entitled to be awarded loss of consortium under the head of filial consortium. Parental Consortium is awarded to children who lose their parents in motor vehicle accidents under the Motor Vehicles Act. The Apex Court held further that, the amount of compensation to be awarded as consortium will be governed by the principles of awarding compensation under 'loss of consortium' as laid down in Pranay Sethi.
